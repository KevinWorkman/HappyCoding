Happy Coding now has [examples](/examples/processing)! And a [forum](http://forum.HappyCoding.io)! And a guide on [how to contribute](https://github.com/KevinWorkman/HappyCoding/wiki/Contributing) to open source (even if you aren't a programmer)!

This is pretty much my "vision" for the site: a bunch of tutorials, a bunch of examples for each tutorial, a place to ask questions, and the ability for other people to get involved if they want to.

In other words, this site is now at the [minimum viable product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) stage. It has all of the core features, and now it's "just" a matter of building on top of what's here. I've built the house, now I just have to start putting furniture in the rooms.

We even have our [first question on the forum](http://forum.happycoding.io/t/processing-code-problem/16) and our [first open source contribution](https://github.com/KevinWorkman/HappyCoding/commits?author=bigbass1997) (thanks Luke!), which is pretty neat.

Writing the examples was really fun, and it brought me back to exactly what I love about programming: creating bite-sized programs that invite experimentation. That feeling of "what would happen if I changed this variable..." is exactly how programming should feel, and it's the whole point of starting this site.

(If you like this art, see [the random walker example](/examples/processing/animation/random-walker) to find out how to create it!)

I've got [a lot of ideas](https://github.com/KevinWorkman/HappyCoding/issues) (and if you want to help with those ideas, [here's how](https://github.com/KevinWorkman/HappyCoding/wiki/Contributing)). I think the next thing I'm going to do is to add the ability to interact with the code in the tutorials and examples. That might just be a link to a [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) for each, or maybe I'll directly embed it in the page so you can play with it right there.

Then it's just rinsing and repeating: adding tutorials, adding examples, adding features that sound fun to implement. I'd also like to add a section specifically for teachers (stuff like lesson plans and whatnot), but that's still pretty fuzzy right now.

I'd love to hear from anybody reading this (note to self: maybe add comments to the blog posts?). What do you think of the tutorials and examples so far? What features would you like to see?
