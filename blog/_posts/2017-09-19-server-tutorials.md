Happy Coding now has [server tutorials](/tutorials/java-server)!

This is a pretty cool milestone for me, because back when I [first started](/blog/hello-world) the site, I said things like "one day I might get to stuff like server tutorials..." - so it's awesome to see how much the tutorials have grown since then.

It's a slow process though. I started writing the server tutorials back in May, and it's September now, so writing the 16 (so far) server tutorials took about 4 months. I try to work a little bit each day: couple of hours on weekday nights, few hours on Saturday. But I'm still not particularly *good* at writing tutorials, so it takes me forever. Not to mention that I'm not exactly an expert on server-side stuff. So a lot of the writing process was formalizing topics in my own brain for the first time. It's stuff I sorta-kinda-mostly knew, but never really organized into a step-by-step process until now. That's interesting, and I learn a lot from doing it, but yeah- it's slooow. :turtle:

That also means that I don't make any visual progress for a while. Even though I work a little bit every day, you wouldn't know that unless you were refreshing the page and looking for changes. I keep telling myself I'll get better at tweeting about new tutorials as I write them, but then again I don't want to announce unfinished stuff. I'd be curious to hear suggestions on this: how would you like to stay updated about what I'm doing?

Anyway, from here I'm going to start writing P5.js tutorials. That's going to be a much simpler process, because I'm going to assume the reader knows both Procesing and JavaScript. I'll talk more about that decision when I'm finished with the P5.js tutorials, but for now I'm looking forward to doing something simple that (fingers crossed) won't take 4 months.

Oh! I also might have some very exciting news in the near future. I don't want to jinx anything, but long story short I might see a path towards using these tutorials in a more official setting. That's more exciting than I can deal with right now.

For now, server tutorials! Yay! I still need to go through and proofread everything, and I want to add a couple more framework tutorials, but after 4 months I'm calling them finished. Let me know what you think or if you have any questions!
