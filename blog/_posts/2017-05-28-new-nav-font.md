I'm going to keep this one short and sweet: I've been playing around with a new nav font! :tada:

**Before:**

Oh no, look how terrible and boring it is! :crying_cat_face:

**After:**

Oh wow! Look how beautiful it is! :scream_cat: :heart_eyes_cat:

Okay yeah it's not the most innovative change in history. But I do think it's an improvement. I wanted to go with a font that felt "computer-y" so I ended up going with a monospaced, blocky font. Something you might see in a console or a code editor. I want to say that I purposely juxtaposed that with random flowing colors (try staring at the nav bar for 30 seconds) to show the mix of ones and zeroes and the more artistic side of programming... but honestly I just thought it looked cool.

This wasn't exactly rocket surgery, but it did involve a lot of mucking about with CSS to get everything to line up in different screen widths. I eventually took advantage of [Bootstrap's](/tutorials/javascript/bootstrap) responsive scaffolding, which allowed me to only really care about 4 different widths. Try resizing the window to see what I'm talking about.

I'd be curious to hear what you think. Does it look okay in your browser? What would you change?

Okay, enough procrastinating. Back to work on server tutorials!
