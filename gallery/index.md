# Gallery

Here are various projects I've worked on. They use the concepts from the [tutorials](/tutorials), but they're a little bigger and more involved than the [examples](/examples).

{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/gallery/movie-colors/index" %}
{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/gallery/comic-book-colors/index" %}
{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/gallery/run-map/index" %}
{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/gallery/spirals/index" %}
{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/gallery/music/index" %}
{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/gallery/46-million-turkeys" %}

# Ludum Dare

[Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/) is a game development "competition" where participants have 48 hours to create a game around a theme that's announced at the beginning of the event. Here are a few of my previous Ludum Dare entries.
