This is my [entry](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46/the-next-generation-conways-game-of-life-puzzles) for [Ludum Dare 46](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46). The theme was **keep it alive**.

Inspired by the recent passing of [John Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway), this is a [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) puzzle game. Click the cells in the big grid to create a pattern, and then click the play button to create a new generation based on the Game of Life rules. You win when the generated pattern matches the goal.

If you beat all 10 levels, you unlock sandbox mode!

Thank you for playing!
