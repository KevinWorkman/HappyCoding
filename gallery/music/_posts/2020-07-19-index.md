<h1>Music Visualization</h1>

This page contains visualizations of various songs and albums. I used [Minim](http://code.compartmental.net/tools/minim/) to get song data, and [Processing](/tutorials/processing) to turn that data into what you see below.

Each line shows the sound level of a song over time. I like that they end up looking like signatures.

Check out this [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/KevinAWorkman/status/1279196831155539971) to see my process.

# Just Jack

## Snowflakes

The first time I heard this song was back in 2002-03. I was 16 or 17, living in Pennsylvania, and the local rock station had a show that played "under the radar" music every Sunday night. This song blew my mind, and it's still one of my favorites.

## The Outer Marker

I've been a big Just Jack fan ever since Snowflakes. His music was there in my teens, 20s, and now 30s. This might be a weird thing to say, but I feel like we grew up together. I recently watched [a livestream concert featuring his daughter](https://www.facebook.com/justjackmusic/videos/969241756811786/). It was heartwarming to reflect on how far we've both come.

# Nora Jane Struthers

A big part of my twenties was attending Nora Jane Struthers concerts, so it felt appropriate that a big part of [my quarantine](/blog/my-quarantine) in 2020 was attending weekly livestream concerts with Nora Jane Struthers and her husband Joe Overton.

## Wait so Long

I didn't know I loved bluegrass music until I heard this song.

## Palomino

It would be a cliche to say that this album helped me get through some stuff, so I'll just say that this album spent some time with me.
