This is my [entry](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/$170999) for [Ludum Dare 45](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45). The theme was **start with nothing**. In this game, you start with black (`#000000`), and you make choices to change your color to white (`#FFFFFF`). Every choice has tradeoffs though, so choose carefully!

If you win (which usually takes about 30 clicks), you can download your color timeline and share your victory on Twitter.

Thank you for playing!
