This is my entry for [Ludum Dare 46](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47). The theme was **stuck in a loop**.

Use the up and down arrow keys (or on-screen buttons on mobile) to avoid the obstacles. Moving in one level moves you in every level, so watch where you're going!

Thank you for playing!
