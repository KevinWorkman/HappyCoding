This is part of [p5 spooky sketches printout](http://tinyurl.com/p5-spooky-sketches) I made for [CC Fest](http://ccfest.rocks/) in 2019. That printout contains a bunch of Halloween-themed examples of drawing and image manipulation. Feel free to use it on your own or in a classroom!

# Remix Ideas

- Draw a pumpkin whenever the user clicks their mouse.
- Turn your pumpkins into Jack-o'-lanterns.
- Make other Halloween decorations, like gourds or ghosts.
