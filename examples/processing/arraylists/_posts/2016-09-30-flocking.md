This program takes the [previous Flocking example](/examples/processing/creating-classes/flocking) and uses an `ArrayList` to allow the user to add `Flocker` instances by dragging the mouse.

You can technically do this using an array and the `append()` function, but using an `ArrayList` is much faster.

```java
ArrayList<Flocker> flock = new ArrayList<Flocker>();

void setup() {
  size(200, 200);
}

void draw() {

  background(200);

  for (Flocker f : flock) {
    f.step();
    f.draw();
  }
}

void mouseDragged() {
  flock.add(new Flocker(mouseX, mouseY));
}

class Flocker {

  float x;
  float y;
  float heading = random(TWO_PI);
  float speed = random(1, 3); 
  float radius = random(10, 20);

  public Flocker(float x, float y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }

  void step() {

    //we need more than one Flocker for this to work
    if (flock.size() > 1) {
      
      //find the closest Flocker
      float closestDistance = 100000;
      Flocker closestFlocker = null;
      for (Flocker f : flock) {

        //make sure not to check against yourself
        if (f != this) {
          float distance = dist(x, y, f.x, f.y);
          if (distance < closestDistance) {
            closestDistance = distance;
            closestFlocker = f;
          }
        }
      }

      float angleToClosest = atan2(closestFlocker.y-y, closestFlocker.x-x);

      //prevent case where heading is 350 and angleToClosest is 10
      if (heading-angleToClosest > PI) {
        angleToClosest += TWO_PI;
      } else if (angleToClosest-heading > PI) {
        angleToClosest -= TWO_PI;
      }

      //turn towards closest
      if (heading < angleToClosest) {
        heading+=PI/40;
      } else {
        heading-=PI/40;
      }

      //move in direction
      x += cos(heading)*speed;
      y += sin(heading)*speed;

      //wrap around edges
      if (x < 0) {
        x = width;
      }
      if (x > width) {
        x = 0;
      }

      if (y < 0) {
        y = height;
      }
      if (y > height) {
        y = 0;
      }
    }
  }

  void draw() {
    ellipse(x, y, radius, radius);
  }
}
```

Watch each `Flocker` and notice that it's just continuously trying to follow its closest neighbor. Even though each individual `Flocker` is only following simple rules, the program itself is a basic simulation of how birds flock, or how bugs swarm, or how a school of fish swims. This idea of complicated (or even beautiful) patterns emerging from simple rules is called [emergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence)!

## Tweak Ideas

- The flocking logic here is very simple and just uses **cohesion** (get close to your neighbors). Better simulations also take **separation** (don't get too close to your neighbors) and **alignment** (fly in the same direction as neighbors) into account. You could also consider the closest 5 (or 10, or...) neighbors instead of only the closest one, or you could consider all of the neighbors within some distance.
- Give each `Flocker` a random color.
- Move the call to `background()` to the `setup()` function to show trails.
- Make them run away from each other instead of chase each other.
- Make one `Flocker` "it" and have it run away from all of the other `Flockers` while they chase it- or vice-versa!
