This project uses POST requests to create a [shoutbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoutbox).

You can run this locally by executing this command:

```
mvn package exec:java
```

This project uses an in-memory `ArrayList` to store data. In real life you'd probably want to use a database like Datastore.
