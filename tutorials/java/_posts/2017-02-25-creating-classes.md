Remember from [the Processing tutorials](/tutorials/processing/creating-classes) that you can create a class to store variables and functions in a single unit, and then you can create **instances** of that class using the `new` keyword.

Let's say we have this class:

```java
public class Message{

	String myMessage;
	
	public Message(String myMessage){
		this.myMessage = myMessage;
	}
	
	public void printMessage(){
		System.out.println(myMessage);
	}
}
```

This code creates a `Message` class that contains a `String` variable named `myMessage`. It has a constructor that sets that variable, and a `printMessage()` function that prints it to the console.

Now we can create instances of that class using the `new` keyword, and we can call functions on those instances:

```java
Message messageOne = new Message("Hello");
Message messageTwo = new Message("Bonjour");
Message messageThree = new Message("Hola");

messageOne.printMessage(); //prints Hello
messageTwo.printMessage(); //prints Bonjour
messageThree.printMessage(); //prints Hola
```

These variables are all of the same class, so they have the same fields and function names. But they're different instances, so the **values** of those fields are different.

## Static

The `static` keyword signifies that a variable or function belongs to the overall class, not to a particular instance. It's like the variable or function is **shared** between all instances of a class. Let's look at an example.

To make a variable or function `static`, just add the `static` keyword to its declaration. This class contains a `static` variable and a `static` function:

```java
public class StaticExample{

	static int myNumber;
	
	public StaticExample(int myNumber){
		this.myNumber = myNumber;
	}
	
	public static void printNumber(){
		System.out.println(myNumber);
	}
}
```

This class contains a `static` variable named `myNumber`, and a constructor that sets that variable. It also contains a `static` function named `printNumber()` that prints the variable.

Now let's write some code that uses this class:

```java
StaticExample one = new StaticExample(42);
StaticExample two = new StaticExample(100);

one.printNumber();
two.printNumber();
```

You might expect this code to print `42` and then `100`, but it actually prints out `100` twice!

This is because the `myNumber` variable is `static`, so both the `one` and `two` instances share the same value. When we pass `100` into the constructor and set the `myNumber` variable, we're setting it for the whole class, not a particular instance. Furthermore, the `printNumber()` function is also static, so even though it looks like we're calling functions on two different instances, we're actually just calling the same class-level function twice.

This is confusing, which is why you should never access a `static` variable or function using an instance. Instead, always use the class name!

With that rule in mind, our `StaticExample.java` file should look like this:

```java
public class StaticExample{

	static int myNumber;
	
	public StaticExample(int myNumber){
		StaticExample.myNumber = myNumber;
	}
	
	public static void printNumber(){
		System.out.println(StaticExample.myNumber);
	}
}
```

Notice that we're using `StaticExample.myNumber` to make it obvious that it's a `static` variable. Now we can see that the constructor is really setting a class-level variable, not an instance variable. The rest of our code would look like this:

```java
StaticExample one = new StaticExample(42);
StaticExample two = new StaticExample(100);

StaticExample.printNumber();
StaticExample.printNumber();
```

Now it's more obvious that we're really just calling the same function twice in a row.

## The `main()` Function

Now you understand what the `static` part of the `main()` function means. It means that the `main()` function doesn't belong to any paticular instance. It belongs to the class itself.

You can put code inside the `main()` function that creates instances of the class. Putting it all together, here's the above example in a single class file:

```java
public class Message{
	
	String myMessage;
	
	public Message(String myMessage){
		this.myMessage = myMessage;
	}
	
	public void printMessage(){
		System.out.println(myMessage);
	}
		
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Message messageOne = new Message("Hello");
		Message messageTwo = new Message("Bonjour");
		Message messageThree = new Message("Hola");

		messageOne.printMessage(); //prints Hello
		messageTwo.printMessage(); //prints Bonjour
		messageThree.printMessage(); //prints Hola
	}
}
```

Try compiling and running this class! If it seems confusing, try thinking about the `main()` function separately from the rest of the class. 

- The class contains one **instance variable** (just another name for a non-static variable) named `myMessage`, which is set by the constructor. Then the class contains a non-static `printMessage()` function that prints the `myMessage` variable.
- The `main()` function creates three instances of the `Message` class, and then calls the `printMessage()` function on each instance.

## Mixing Static and Non-Static

All of this might not seem very useful other than explaining what the `static` part of the `main()` method means. But `static` variables and functions can be useful when you want to share data between instances, or when you don't want to tie a variable or function to a particular instance.

Note that you've already been using a static variable! The `System` class has a `static` variable named `out`, which is an instance of the `PrintStream` class, which contains a `println()` function. Look it up in [the Java API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/)!

Let's add a `static` variable and function to our `Message` class:

```java
public class Message{

	static int instanceCount = 0;
	
	String myMessage;
	
	public Message(String myMessage){
		this.myMessage = myMessage;
		Message.instanceCount++;
	}
	
	public void printMessage(){
		System.out.println(myMessage);
	}
	
	public static void printInstanceCount(){
		System.out.println("There are " + Message.instanceCount + " instances of Message.");
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Message messageOne = new Message("Hello");
		Message messageTwo = new Message("Bonjour");
		Message messageThree = new Message("Hola");

		messageOne.printMessage(); //prints Hello
		messageTwo.printMessage(); //prints Bonjour
		messageThree.printMessage(); //prints Hola

		Message.printInstanceCount(); //prints 3
	}
}
```

Try compiling and running this class! If it seems confusing, try thinking about the `main()` function separately from the rest of the class. 

- The class contains two variables: an instance (non-static) variable named `myMessage` and a `static` variable named `instanceCount`. The constructor sets the `myMessage` variable and increments the `instanceCount` variable. Then the class contains a non-static `printMessage()` function that prints the `myMessage` variable, and a `static` `printInstanceCount()` function that prints the `instanceCount` variable.
- The `main()` function creates three instances of the `Message` class, calls the `printMessage()` function on each instance, and then calls the `printInstanceCount()` statically by using the class name.

In this example, the `instanceCount` variable holds the total number of instances of the `Message` class, which isn't particular to any one instance of the class, so we make it `static`. Similarly, the `printInstanceCount()` function isn't different between instances, so we make it `static` as well.

## Multiple Classes

It might seem confusing to have a `main()` function inside a class that creates instances of that class. Just remember that the `main()` function is `static`, so it's "outside" any particular instance. It might be easier to understand if you put the `main()` function inside a different class.

Let's start with the first class:

```java
public class Message{

	static int instanceCount = 0;
	
	String myMessage;
	
	public Message(String myMessage){
		this.myMessage = myMessage;
		instanceCount++;
	}
	
	public void printMessage(){
		System.out.println(myMessage);
	}
	
	public static void printInstanceCount(){
		System.out.println("There are " + instanceCount + " instances of Message.");
	}
}
```

Save this to a file named `Message.java`. This is the same class we've been looking at. Notice that it doesn't have a `main()` method, so you can't run it.

Now let's create another class that contains a `main()` method that uses our first class:

```java
public class MessageMain{
	
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Message messageOne = new Message("Hello");
		Message messageTwo = new Message("Bonjour");
		Message messageThree = new Message("Hola");

		messageOne.printMessage(); //prints Hello
		messageTwo.printMessage(); //prints Bonjour
		messageThree.printMessage(); //prints Hola

		Message.printInstanceCount(); //prints 3
	}
}
```

Save this to a file named `MessageMain.java`. This class just contains a `main()` method with the same code we've been running. Hopefully this makes the code a little easier to think about.

Now you've got two files: `Message.java` and `MessageMain.java`. You need to compile both of these classes. You have a couple ways to do that:

- You could just compile `MessageMain.java` by typing `javac MessageMain.java` and pressing enter. The compiler will see that the `MessageMain` class uses the `Message` class, so it will automatically compile both files.
- Or you could compile all of your classes by typing `javac *.java` and pressing enter. This tells the compiler to compile every file that ends with a `.java` extension.

Either way, you should end up with two more files: `Message.class` and `MessageMain.class`. Since our `main()` function is inside the `MessageMain` class, that's the one we want to run by typing `java MessageMain` and pressing enter.

Most Java applications will use a bunch of different class files, and it's pretty normal to have an "entry point" class that contains just a `main()` function that uses other classes.

## The `non-static variable cannot be referenced from a static context` Error

Let's looks at this example program:

```java
public class Cat{
	
	String name = "Stanley";
	
	public static void main(String[] args){
		
		Cat catOne = new Cat();
		catOne.name = "Fluffy";
		
		Cat catTwo = new Cat();
		catTwo.name = "Professor Meow";
		
		System.out.println("First cat's name: " + catOne.name);
		System.out.println("Second cat's name: " + catTwo.name);
	}
}
```

This `Cat` class contains one instance (non-static) variable called `name`, with a default value of `"Stanley"`. Then the `main()` function creates two instances of the `Cat` class, giving each of them their own value for the `name` variable. Finally, this code will print out two different names, because each instances of `Cat` has its own `name` value.

All of that is good so far. But I promise that you will eventually write code that looks like this:

```java
public class Cat{
	
	String name = "Stanley";
	
	public static void main(String[] args){
		System.out.println(name);
	}
}
```

If you try to compile this class, you'll get a compiler error:

```java
Cat.java:6: error: non-static variable name cannot be referenced from a static context
                System.out.println(name);
                                   ^
1 error
```

This error is telling you that you're trying to use a non-static variable (in this case, the `name` variable) from a `static` function (in this case, the `main()` function). You can't access non-static variables from static functions, so the compiler gives you this error.

This might sound confusing, but think about it this way: when you type the `name` variable, you're asking for a particular cat's name. But you haven't specified which instance to use, so the compiler is saying "I can't give you a cat's name if you don't tell me which cat's name you want!"

To fix this error, you might be tempted to make the `name` variable `static`, like this:

```java
public class Cat{
	
	static String name = "Stanley";
	
	public static void main(String[] args){
		System.out.println(name);
	}
}
```

**Don't do this!** Making the `name` variable `static` will fix this particular error, but it completely breaks the point of instance variables. What would happen if we tried to create multiple instances of this class?

```java
public class Cat{
	
	static String name = "Stanley";
	
	public static void main(String[] args){
		
		Cat catOne = new Cat();
		catOne.name = "Fluffy";
		
		Cat catTwo = new Cat();
		catTwo.name = "Professor Meow";
		
		System.out.println("First cat's name: " + catOne.name);
		System.out.println("Second cat's name: " + catTwo.name);
	}
}
```

Now both cats will have the same name, because the `name` variable is not particular to any one instance.

Instead of making the `name` variable `static`, what we probably should have done is created an instance of `Cat` and got the name function that way:

```java
public class Cat{
	
	String name = "Stanley";
	
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Cat cat = new Cat();
		System.out.println(cat.name);
	}
}
```

Or we should have moved our logic into a function in the `Cat` class and used that instead of putting logic in the `main()` method:

```java
public class Cat{
	
	String name = "Stanley";
	
	public void printName(){
		System.out.println(name);
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Cat cat = new Cat();
		cat.printName();
	}
}
```

This code works, because the `main()` method is creating an instance of the `Cat` class, and then calling the `printName()` function of that instance. The `printName()` function is non-static, so it can access the non-static `name` variable.

## Passing Data Between Classes

Let's look at another example. Let's say we have two classes. First, we have a `Main` class:

```java
public class Main{
	String message;
	
	public Main(String message){
		this.message = message;
	}
	
	public void runProgram(){
		MessagePrinter mp = new MessagePrinter();
		mp.printMessage();
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Main main = new Main("Happy Coding");
		main.runProgram();
	}	
}
```

This class contains one variable named `message`, which is set by the constructor. It also has a `runProgram()` function that creates an instance of `MessagePrinter` (which we'll see in a second) and calls its `printMessage()` function. The `main()` function just creates an instance of `Main`, passing in a `String` value, and then calls the `runProgram()` function on that instance.

Now we try to create a `MessagePrinter` class whose job it is to print the `message` variable from the `Main` class. How would we do that?

```java
public class MessagePrinter{
	public void printMessage(){
		//I want to print the message variable from the Main class!
	}
}
```

Again, you might be tempted to make the `message` variable static, so you could do this:

```java
public class MessagePrinter{
	public void printMessage(){
		System.out.println(Main.message);
	}
}
```

**Don't do this!** Again, this completely defeats the purpose of instance variables. What if you eventually want to have more than one instance of the `Main` class?

Instead, you need to pass the data from the `Main` class to the `MessagePrinter` class. For example, you could add a parameter to the `printMessage()` function:

```java
public class MessagePrinter{
	public void printMessage(String message){
		System.out.println(message);
	}
}
```

Then the `Main` class could pass its `message` variable in as an argument:

```java
public void runProgram(){
	MessagePrinter mp = new MessagePrinter();
	mp.printMessage(message);
}
```

Another option is to pass the instance of `Main` into the `MessagePrinter` class. You could pass it as an argument to the constructor:

```java
public class MessagePrinter{
	
	Main main;
	
	public MessagePrinter(Main main){
		this.main = main;
	}
	
	public void printMessage(){
		System.out.println(main.message);
	}
}
```

Now the `MessagePrinter` class has an instance of `Main`, so it can get to the `message` variable that way. (Better yet, you could use a getter function instead. See the Access Modifiers section below.)

Now when the `Main` class creates an instance of `MessagePrinter`, it needs to pass a reference to itself into the constructor. We can use the `this` keyword for that!

```java
public void runProgram(){
	MessagePrinter mp = new MessagePrinter(this);
	mp.printMessage();
}
```

You should never use the `static` keyword because you think it gets rid of errors or because you think it's easier to pass data between classes. Use the above approaches instead!

## Packages

As your programs get more complicated and you start using more class files, you might want to split them up into **packages**. Packages are collections of related classes, and they let you organize your files into folders.

Using a package is really two things:

- Oranize your `.java` files into folders.
- Add package declarations to those classes.

Let's look at a concrete example. Let's say we want to create a set of `.java` files inside a folder structure, like this:

- MyZoo
  - main
    - Main.java
  - animals
    - Zoo.java
    - mammals
      - Cat.java
    - reptiles
      - Dinosaur.java
      
In other words, we have a single directory named `MyZoo` that holds our whole program. The `MyZoo` folder contains two other folders: `main` and `animals`. The `main` folder contains a single file named `Main.java`. The `animals` folder contains a file named `Zoo.java`, and two sub-folders named `mammals` and `reptiles`. The `mammals` folder contains a `Cat.java` file, and the `reptiles` folder contains a `Dinosaur.java` file.

Let's start with the `Cat.java` file:

```java
package animals.mammals;

public class Cat{
	public void meow(){
		System.out.println("Meow!");	
	}
}
```

The only interesting thing here is the first line at the top. This is a **package declaration**, and it should always be the first line in a file. This line tells Java that the `Cat` class is inside the `animals.mammals` package, which matches the `.java` file being inside the `animals/mammals` subdirectory.

Similarly, `Dinosaur.java` has a package declaration putting it in the `animals.reptiles` package:

```java
package animals.reptiles;

public class Dinosaur{
	public void roar(){
		System.out.println("Roar!");
	}
}
```

The `Zoo.java` file is a little more interesting:

```java
package animals;

import animals.mammals.Cat;
import animals.reptiles.Dinosaur;

public class Zoo{
	
	Cat cat = new Cat();
	Dinosaur dinosaur = new Dinosaur();
	
	public void visit(){
		System.out.println("Let's visit the cat.");
		cat.meow();
		System.out.println("Let's visit the dinosaur.");
		dinosaur.roar();
	}
}
```

This code starts with a package declaration saying it's in the `animals` package. Then it **imports** our first two classes using their package and class names. That lets us use those classes inside the `Zoo` class.

Finally, our `Main.java` file does something similar:

```java
package main;

import animals.Zoo;

public class Main{

	public static void main(String[] args){
		Zoo zoo = new Zoo();
		
		System.out.println("Let's go to the zoo!");
		zoo.visit();
		System.out.println("That was a fun day at the zoo.");
	}
}
```

This code starts with a package declaration, then imports the `animals.Zoo` class. Then it contains a `main()` method that uses the `Zoo` class. Hooray! :tada:

To compile this program, we'd open a command prompt to the top-level `MyZoo` directory. From there, we'd type `javac main/Main.java` to compile the `Main.java` class. Since this class uses the `Zoo` class, which uses `Cat` and `Dinosaur` classes, compiling `Main.java` causes every class to be compiled. But note that you have to do this from the top-level `MyZoo` directory!

Now that we've compiled our classes, we can run our program by typing `java main.Main` and pressing enter. Note that we also have to do this from the top-level `MyZoo` directory, and notice that we use dots instead of slashes!

The whole process looks like this:

![running the zoo program](/tutorials/java/images/creating-classes-1.png)

## Access Modifiers

You might have noticed the `public` keyword in some of our code. That's called an **access modifier**, which tells Java who can access a member (a variable or function).

There are a few access modifiers:

- `public` members can be accessed by any class.
- `private` members can only be accessed by that class.
- `protected` members can be accessed by classes in the same package or by subclasses (it's okay if you don't know what this means yet).
- If you don't specify an access modifier, the member can be accessed by classes in the same package.

This might not seem useful for simple code or code that only you work on. But it becomes really important if you're writing code with other people!

Usually, most variables are `private`, and only the constructors and functions that other people should use are `public`.

For example, let's say you and another person are working together, with a goal of creating a program that only prints out three things. You split the work up: you'll create a class that contains the logic for counting the things that have been printed, and the other person will pass data into your class.

So, you write your code:

```java
public class PrintThreeTimes{

	int timesPrinted = 0;
	
	public void print(String thing){
		if(timesPrinted < 3){
			System.out.println(thing);
			timesPrinted++;
		}
		else{
			System.out.println("Sorry, I can't print anything else.");
		}
	}
}
```

This code works, and the `print()` function will only print the parameter three times. After that it will print an error message.

Now, your partner comes along and writes this code, which uses your class:

```java
public class SomebodyElsesCode{
	public static void main(String[] args){
	
		PrintThreeTimes ptt = new PrintThreeTimes();
		ptt.print("thing one");
		ptt.print("thing two");
		ptt.print("thing three");
		ptt.print("thing four");
	}
}
```

This correctly prints out three things and then an error message:

```
thing one
thing two
thing three
Sorry, I can't print anything else.
```

However, your partner wasn't really paying attention, and they think that the goal was to print **four** things instead of three! They know they aren't supposed to change the code you wrote, but they also see that the `timesPrinted` variable is not private. This tells them that they are **supposed** to change that variable. So they modify their code:

```java
public class SomebodyElsesCode{
	public static void main(String[] args){
	
		PrintThreeTimes ptt = new PrintThreeTimes();
		ptt.print("thing one");
		ptt.print("thing two");
		ptt.print("thing three");
		
		ptt.timesPrinted = 0;
		
		ptt.print("thing four");
	}
}
```

Now this code "works" and allows four things to be printed, and your partner submits it. If this is a school assignment, now you're getting a bad grade. If this is a work assignment, now you're getting fired! And it could have been avoided if you had simply made the `timesPrinted` variable `private` in the first place:

```java
public class PrintThreeTimes{

	private int timesPrinted = 0;
	
	public void print(String thing){
		if(timesPrinted < 3){
			System.out.println(thing);
			timesPrinted++;
		}
		else{
			System.out.println("Sorry, I can't print anything else.");
		}
	}
}
```

Now nobody else can touch the `timesPrinted` variable, and they'll get a compiler error if they try. This tells them that they aren't supposed to modify the value of the variable. In this example, maybe this causes your partner to read the instructions again, or maybe they ask you about it. Either way, you end up with a better grade and you aren't fired!

If you want to allow other people to know the value of a variable but not change it, you can use a **getter function** that just returns the value of the variable:

```java
public class PrintThreeTimes{

	private int timesPrinted = 0;
	
	public int getTimesPrinted(){
		return timesPrinted;
	}
	
	public void print(String thing){
		if(timesPrinted < 3){
			System.out.println(thing);
			timesPrinted++;
		}
		else{
			System.out.println("Sorry, I can't print anything else.");
		}
	}
}
```

Now your partner can **get** the value of the variable, so they can check when the limit has been reached. But they can't **set** the value of the variable, so they can't get you fired.

This is admittedly a dumb example, but it's not that far-fetched: a "real" program that only has a limited number of connections to a database might use code almost exactly like this.

Real code is going to be much more complicated, so get in the habit of marking your variables `private` now.

## Summary

This was a bit of an information dump, but you're going to see all of the above sooner rather than later. Processing hid a lot of these details from you, but you need to understand what's going on behind the scenes when you're programming in Java.

You don't have to memorize the stuff in this tutorial. Instead, try to keep the general principles in mind:

- Split your program up into separate classes, and put each class in its own file.
- Use the command line to compile and run your classes.
- Understand `static`, but don't misuse it to pass data between classes.
- Understand packages, and split your Java files into directories.
- Make variables `private`.

And if you find yourself needing to remember a particular detail (how do I pass data between classes again?), then come back here and read the tutorial again.

## Homework

- Expand the zoo example. Add classes for different types of animals, and organize them into packages. Can you think of other packages that might come in handy?
