<h1>Tutorials</h1>

<hr>

<p>At its core, Happy Coding is a collection of tutorials that take you from the fundamentals of creative coding, through more advanced topics like Android, making games, and web development, all the way through interviewing for a software engineering job.</p>

<p>If that sounds like a lot, that's okay! Start here:</p>

<h1>Creative Coding</h1>

<hr>

<p>Creative coding is all about using code to make stuff that looks cool. You can think of this as interactive digital art, or procedural generation, or just playing around and seeing what you can come up with.</p>

<p>Processing and p5.js are popular languages used in creative coding, and they're designed to be easy to get started with. If you've never written a line of code before, this where you should start!</p>
