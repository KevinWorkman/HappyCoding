## Into to Creative Coding

These tutorials are designed for folks who are new to coding.

If you've never written a line of code before, or if you've taken an intro course and want to learn more about creative coding, these are for you!

- Start with the [How to Learn Coding](/tutorials/how-to/learn-coding) meta-guide about learning with Happy Coding!
- Are you new to coding? Start learning about creative coding with the [p5.js tutorials](/tutorials/p5js).
- Have some Java experience? Start with the [Processing tutorials](/tutorials/processing)!

{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/how-to/learn-coding" %}
{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/p5js/" %}
{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/processing/" %}
</div>


Not sure which is right for you? Read the [Which Processing should I use?](/tutorials/p5js/which-processing) guide to learn how it all fits together.

## Roadmap

After you learn about the fundamentals of coding, you can learn more advanced topics in whatever order seems most interesting to you. But if it helps, here's the order I would recommend:

## Web Development

Learn how to make websites.

<div class="thumbnail-link-container">
{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/p5js/" %}
{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/html/" %}
{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/javascript/" %}
</div>

---

## Java

Starting with Processing, Java takes you on a path to advanced topics like server-side coding and Android development.

<div class="thumbnail-link-container">
{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/processing/" %}
{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/java/" %}
{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/java-server/" %}
{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/google-cloud/" %}
{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/android/" %}
{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/libgdx/" %}
</div>
