# HTML Tutorials

Web development is a huge topic that involves lots of different concepts. Figuring out exactly where to start can be pretty overwhelming, so my hope is that these HTML tutorials can help you break these concepts down into more digestible chunks, which will then hopefully help you get started learning about building websites.

These HTML tutorials are not meant to be a standalone resource that will teach you everything there is to know about web development. Instead, they're meant to introduce the fundamental concepts and how they fit together, which will hopefully make it easier for you to then learn from places like [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/).

If you want to build a website, then you're in the right place! These tutorials are designed for folks who have never written any HTML before. But if you're trying to get into coding more generally, I'd suggest starting with the [p5.js tutorials](/tutorials/p5js) first and then coming back here.

HTML is the one of the most fundamental building blocks of the internet. HTML lets you build websites yourself, without going through a website builder or a social media platform.

If you're ready to start making your own websites, read through these tutorials!

# GitHub Pages

These tutorials walk you through the process of using HTML to create your own site on GitHub Pages, starting with your GitHub profile README and ending with Jekyll, which is how I build Happy Coding!
