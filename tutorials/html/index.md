# HTML Tutorials

HTML is the one of the most fundamental building blocks of the internet. HTML lets you build websites yourself, without going through a website builder or a social media platform.

If you know you want to build a website, then you're in the right place! These tutorials are designed for folks who have never written any HTML before. But if you're trying to get into coding more generally, I'd suggest starting with the [p5.js tutorials](/tutorials/p5js) first and then coming back here.

If you're ready to start making your own websites, read through these tutorials!
