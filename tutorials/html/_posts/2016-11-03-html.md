This tutorial introduces HTML, which is the foundational coding language used for building websites.

# Coding Languages

Think about how many human languages exist in the world: English, Spanish, Japanese, etc. Each one evolved its own **syntax** (the letters, words, and symbols of a language) and **grammar** (the rules about how you can use those letters, words, and symbols) over many years. For example, some languages put nouns before adjectives. Some languages are written right-to-left instead of left-to-right. Some even use completely different letters and symbols!

Coding languages are very similar. They've evolved their own syntax (symbols) and grammar (rules) over many years. Different coding languages are designed for different goals, and which one you choose depends on what you're trying to do.

HTML is a coding language designed for building webpages.

HTML tells a web browser how to display content. That content is often text, but it can also be things like links, images, videos, and sound files.

You write HTML by adding **tags** to your content, which tells the browser what to do with the content. For example, the `<h1>` tag tells the browser that something is a heading, the `<p>` tag tells the browser that text is a paragraph, and the `<img>` tag tells the browser to display an image.

# Code Editors

You'll learn more about HTML tags as you read through these tutorials, but first you'll need to create an HTML file!

Pick one of these tutorial to set up your coding environment.

If you're new to coding and HTML, I recommend using an online code editor:

{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/html/online-code-editors" %}

Or you can edit files directly on your own computer:

{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/html/local-files" %}

# HTML Tags

You write HTML by adding **tags** to your content, which tells the browser what to do with the content. For example, the `<h1>` tag tells the browser that something is a heading, the `<p>` tag tells the browser that text is a paragraph, and the `<img>` tag tells the browser to display an image.

A tag has a **name** which goes between `< >` angle brackets, and contains **content** which goes between an opening and closing tag. A closing tag is a `/` forward slash followed by the tag name, both in angle brackets.

For example, the `<h1>` tag tells the browser that the content is a heading.

So this HTML:

```html
<h1>Hello world!</h1>
```

Shows up like this in your browser:

<hr/>
<h1>Hello world!</h1>
<hr/>

You'll learn more about HTML tags in the [HTML tags tutorials](/tutorials/html/html-tags).

# Terminology

This tutorial used the term HTML quite a few times, but I still haven't defined what HTML actually means. You don't _really_ need to know all of this background information, but if you're curious, here's where the term HTML comes from.

[Hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext) is text that can link to other text using [hyperlinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink). That might sound confusing, but you've seen this before, on any webpage that links to other webpages. (Like the one you're reading right now!) There are also [older examples of hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_hypertext).

[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, which is a way for one computer to send hypertext to another computer. It's how your browser asks for HTML from a specific URL, and the [world wide web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web) is built on top of HTTP.

[Markup languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language) are ways to add formatting to text. For example, you might have seen inputs where text between asterisks like `*this*` is rendered as bold like **this**. That's one kind of markup language.

Finally, [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) stands for **H**yper**t**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage, because it's a way to write markup (using HTML tags) to tell your browser how to display hypertext.

Don't worry, you don't need to memorize any of that. But I think the history of this stuff is really interesting!

# Homework

- Edit your HTML file to include a few paragraphs describing who you are, why you're learning about html, and what you hope to get out of these tutorials.
- Look at some websites you use. What types of content do they contain? How do you think that content is marked up in html?
