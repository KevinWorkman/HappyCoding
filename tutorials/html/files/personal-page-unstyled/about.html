	<p>This is an example about section. You might explain more about yourself, or the webpage, or give links to other resources.</p>
	
	<p>My name is Kevin. I write programming tutorials at <a href="http://HappyCoding.io">HappyCoding.io</a>, and I have a cat named Stanley. My favorite color is black, but if that doesn't count then I'll choose green. I also like comic books and playing bikes.</p>
