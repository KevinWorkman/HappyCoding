[App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) is a Google Cloud framework for launching and running your code on Google servers so anyone can access it using a public URL.

At this point you've deployed the "hello world" project from the [Google Cloud Setup](/tutorials/google-cloud/setup) tutorial, using the `mvn package exec:java` and `mvn package appengine:deploy` commands.

Those commands deploy to App Engine, either locally or to your live server. This tutorial talks about App Engine in more detail.

# Hello World

If you haven't already, you can download a barebones example webapp from [here](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/KevinWorkman/HappyCoding/tree/gh-pages/examples/google-cloud/google-cloud-example-projects/app-engine-hello-world).

This project is an `app-engine-hello-world` directory with subdirectories that contain 5 files::

- `app-engine-hello-world/`
  - **`pom.xml`** is a Maven [POM file](https://maven.apache.org/pom.html) that defines the project.
  - `src/main/` is a directory that contains the code.
    - `appengine/`**`app.yaml`** is a [config file](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java11/config/appref) that sets up App Engine. The hello world project only uses a single property that sets the runtime to Java 11.
    - `java/` is a directory that contains server-side code.
      - `io.happycoding.`**`ServerMain.java`** is the main class that sets up the server.
      - `io.happycoding.servlets.`**`HelloWorldServlet.java`** is a Java servlet that returns some HTML content.
    - `webapp/` is a directory that contains web files.
      - **`index.html`** is an HTML file that shows static content.

Navigate to the `app-enging-hello-world` directory in a command line, and then execute this command:

```
mvn package exec:java
```

When the command completes and you'll see this in your command line:

```
Server started!
```

Next, visit this URL in a web browser:

[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

(If you're using Google Cloud Shell, use the [web preview](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/using-web-preview) button. Anywhere you see `localhost` in these tutorials, use the web preview button instead.)

This URL points to the local server that you just ran. When you navigate to that URL, you should see this:

![local server](/tutorials/google-cloud/images/setup-7.png)

This is the HTML content of the `index.html` file in our project.

Navigate to [localhost:8080/hello](http://localhost:8080/hello) to view the content that's served by the `HelloWorldServlet` class.

The rest of this tutorial explains this example in more detail.

# Server Entry Point

App Engine can run any Java program, starting from a `main` method. This program doesn't **have** to be a server; for example you could use App Engine to run a program that processes a lot of data, without needing to slow down your own computer. The example runs a server, and most likely that's what you're here to do, but it's not the **only** thing you can do.

Anyway, in the example, the `main` method is in the `ServerMain` class.

```java
package io.happycoding;

import java.net.URL;
import org.eclipse.jetty.annotations.AnnotationConfiguration;
import org.eclipse.jetty.server.Handler;
import org.eclipse.jetty.server.handler.DefaultHandler;
import org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server;
import org.eclipse.jetty.servlet.DefaultServlet;
import org.eclipse.jetty.webapp.Configuration;
import org.eclipse.jetty.webapp.WebAppContext;
import org.eclipse.jetty.webapp.WebInfConfiguration;

/**
 * Starts up the server, including a DefaultServlet that handles static files,
 * and any servlet classes annotated with the @WebServlet annotation.
 */
public class ServerMain {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

    // Create a server that listens on port 8080.
    Server server = new Server(8080);
    WebAppContext webAppContext = new WebAppContext();
    server.setHandler(webAppContext);

    // Load static content from inside the jar file.
    URL webAppDir =
        ServerMain.class.getClassLoader().getResource("META-INF/resources");
    webAppContext.setResourceBase(webAppDir.toURI().toString());

    // Enable annotations so the server sees classes annotated with @WebServlet.
    webAppContext.setConfigurations(new Configuration[]{ 
      new AnnotationConfiguration(),
      new WebInfConfiguration(), 
    });

    // Look for annotations in the classes directory (dev server) and in the
    // jar file (live server)
    webAppContext.setAttribute(
        "org.eclipse.jetty.server.webapp.ContainerIncludeJarPattern", 
        ".*/target/classes/|.*\\.jar");

    // Handle static resources, e.g. html files.
    webAppContext.addServlet(DefaultServlet.class, "/");

    // Start the server! ðŸš€
    server.start();
    System.out.println("Server started!");

    // Keep the main thread alive while the server is running.
    server.join();
  }
}
```

This code uses [Jetty](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) to create a server. It loads static resource from inside the jar file, and looks for servlet classes with the `@WebServlet` annotation.

This `main` method runs a **server**, which is a program that **serves** content when users request a particular URL. When you run locally, your computer acts as the server. When you deploy to App Engine, a computer inside Google's infrastructure acts as the server.

(If you're using Google Cloud shell, then running a "local" server really runs a live server that only you can access.)

# Servlets

Servers support many programming languages and types of code. The examples in these tutorials use the **Java servlet API** which is a framework based on Java classes that handle server requests.

If you're new to servlets, you should read through the [Java servlets](/tutorials/java-server/servlets) tutorial before continuing. At the very least, make sure you understand that when a user makes a request to the `/hello` URL, that request is routed to the `HelloWorldServlet` class, which returns a response.

# Static Content

You can also serve static content from your App Engine server. The hello world project contains one `index.html` file. Other static content might include JavaScript, CSS, or image files.

# app.yaml

The `app.yaml` file contains configuration data required by App Engine.

This example only contains a single property that sets the runtime to Java 11. See [this page](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java11/config/appref) for more properties you can use.

# pom.xml

The `pom.xml` is a Maven [POM file](https://maven.apache.org/pom.html) that defines the project and ties everything together.

The example project uses four Maven plugins to package and run the server.

- The [Resources Plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-resources-plugin/) (`maven-resources-plugin`) makes sure that static content like HTML files are included in the output jar file. This allows the `ServerMain` class to load this content.

```java
// Load static content from inside the jar file.
URL webAppDir =
    ServerMain.class.getClassLoader().getResource("META-INF/resources");
webAppContext.setResourceBase(webAppDir.toURI().toString());
```

- The [Shade Plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/) (`maven-shade-plugin`) packages everything into a single executable jar file, which makes it easier to run the server.
- The [Exec Plugin](https://www.mojohaus.org/exec-maven-plugin/) (`exec-maven-plugin`) runs a local server by executing the `main` method in the `ServerMain` class.
- The [App Engine Plugin](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/using-maven) (`appengine-maven-plugin`) handles deploying to the live server by uploading the executable jar file to App Engine.

# Multiple Instances

By default, App Engine will automatically scale based on how many requests it's receiving.

In other words, if only a few people are using your webapp, all of your requests are probably served from a single instance of your project. But if you suddenly get a spike of traffic, App Engine will create more instances to deal with the extra traffic automatically.

This means you don't have to worry about your code crashing if you get a surge of new users, but it also means you have to be careful about how you handle data.

Consider this example servlet:

```java
@WebServlet("/increment")
public class CountingServlet extends HttpServlet {

  int count = 0;

  @Override
  public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {
    count++;

    response.setContentType("text/html;");
    response.getOutputStream().println("<h1>Count: " + count + "</h1>");
  }
}
```

This servlet maintains a `count` variable. Whenever a user visits the `/increment` URL, it increments the `count` variable and then responds with some HTML that displays the current count.

If you run this locally, it'll work fine.

But if you deploy this to your live server, and many users flock to your site, then App Engine will spawn a new instance of your project to handle the incoming requests. This new instance will have its own `count` variable, which will start over at 0. Depending on which instance your users are routed to, they'll see different data. I've personally been caught by this myself, so watch out for it!

The solution to this problem is to not rely on in-memory data like this, and to use a service like Datastore instead.

You can read more about App Engine scaling [here](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java11/how-instances-are-managed).

# Automatic Shutdown

Similar to how App Engine creates new instances if your project receives a lot of traffic, it will also shutdown instances if your project receives no traffic.

By default, App Engine will shutdown your project after 15 minutes of inactivity. Don't worry, when it receives a new request, it'll automatically run a new instance!

You generally don't have to worry about this, but if you notice that your live site takes a few seconds to refresh when you come back to it, that's probably because it's spinning back up after being shutdown due to inactivity.

You can read more about this [here](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java11/how-instances-are-managed).

# Logs

When you're running locally, your logs and print statements will output to your command line.

For you live server, your logs and print statements are available in the **Logging** tab at [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com) (direct link [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs)). You should see something like this:

![Google Cloud logs](/tutorials/google-cloud/images/app-engine-1.png)

The logs in this screenshot list each request made to my server: one to `/`, one to `/favicon.ico`, another to `/`, and one to `/hello`.

You can click on any of the requests to view the logs for it. In the screenshot, I've expanded the `/hello` request, which shows more information about that request. **This is where stack traces, logs, and print statements show up.**

To debug a request that's behaving differently from what you expected, you'll generally go to this logging page, find the request you're trying to debug, and then expand it to see its output.

This can be a little confusing, so I'd recommend playing around with this a bit. Try adding a print statement to your servlet and finding it in the logging page. If you wait until you're trying to debug a user problem to learn how the logs work, you're going to have a bad time, so take some time to learn it now!

# Other Approaches

I wrote this example with the goal of making it easy to deploy a server without worrying about any complicated frameworks or dealing with static resources or dependencies, but there are **many** ways to approach this.

For example, you might use a framework like [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) or [Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/), or you might separate the main class into its own project and package your server code into a war file. See [this page](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java11/runtime#framework_compatibility) and [these examples](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/java-docs-samples/tree/master/appengine-java11) for more information.

There is no single correct way to deploy a server to App Engine, so you'll likely encounter other approaches. If you see discrepancies between my examples and other examples you find on the internet (stuff like using a `web.xml` file instead of annotations or using a framework instead of Jetty and servlets), that's okay!

I like Jetty and servlets because they allow me to focus on the fundamentals, but I recommend trying to figure out what makes the most sense to you and your project.

# Summary

App Engine can run any Java program, and the [hello world example](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/KevinWorkman/HappyCoding/tree/gh-pages/examples/google-cloud/google-cloud-example-projects/app-engine-hello-world) uses [Jetty](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) to create a server. The `pom.xml` file packages all of the static content and dependencies into a single executable jar file. That jar file can be run either locally or uploaded to App Engine to run a live server.
