# Google Cloud Tutorials

[Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) is a collection of tools, libraries, frameworks, and services that allow you to run code using the power of Google's infrastructure.

Google Cloud contains a lot of really fun stuff, but it's not exactly friendly to novices. Before jumping into these tutorials, make sure you're familiar with [Java](/tutorials/java). Specifically, make sure you're comfortable with [OOP and inheritance](/tutorials/java/inheritance) and [classpath and libraries](/tutorials/java/libraries).

The full code for the examples used in these tutorials is available [here](https://github.com/KevinWorkman/GoogleCloudExamples).
