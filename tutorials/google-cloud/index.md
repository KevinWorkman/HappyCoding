# Google Cloud Tutorials

[Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) is a collection of tools, libraries, frameworks, and services that allow you to run code using the power of Google's infrastructure.

Google Cloud contains a lot of really fun stuff, but it's not exactly friendly to novices. Before jumping into these tutorials, make sure you're familiar with [Java](/tutorials/java). Specifically, make sure you're comfortable with [OOP and inheritance](/tutorials/java/inheritance) and [classpath and libraries](/tutorials/java/libraries).

The full code for the examples used in these tutorials is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/KevinWorkman/GoogleCloudExamples).

These tutorials have been updated to use Java 11 and the latest Cloud SDK.

# Legacy Java 8 Tutorials

These tutorials use Java 8 and the standalone App Engine SDK, which is now deprecated. I'm leaving these for reference.

{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/google-cloud/java-8/app-engine" %}
