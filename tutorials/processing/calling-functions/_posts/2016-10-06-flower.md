```java
size(200, 300);

//draw green stem
strokeWeight(10);
stroke(0, 128, 0);
line(100, 100, 100, 300);

//leafs
ellipse(105, 200, 10, 10);
ellipse(95, 225, 10, 10);

//change stroke back to thin black line
strokeWeight(1);
stroke(0);

//draw petals
fill(255, 100, 0);
ellipse(50, 50, 100, 100);
ellipse(150, 50, 100, 100);
ellipse(50, 150, 100, 100);
ellipse(150, 150, 100, 100);

//draw middle part
fill(255, 128, 0);
ellipse(100, 100, 100, 100);
```

This code calls a series of functions do draw a flower:

## Tweak Ideas

- Draw a more realistic flower.
- Draw a whole vine of flowers.
- Use a piece of paper and a pen to draw a flower by hand. Try to recreate that using code!
