```java
size(500, 500);

int rows = 10;
int cols = 10;

int cellHeight = height/rows;
int cellWidth = width/cols;

textAlign(CENTER, CENTER);
textSize(28);

background(32);

for(int y = 0; y < rows; y++){
  for(int x = 0; x < cols; x++){

    //get a random ascii letter
    char c = '!';
    c += random(93);

    //calculate cell position
    int pixelX = cellWidth * x;
    int pixelY = cellHeight * y;

    //add half to center letters
    pixelX += cellWidth/2;
    pixelY += cellHeight/2;

    fill(random(256));
    text(c, pixelX, pixelY);
  }
}
```

This code uses nested `for` loops to draw a grid of random letters.

The code uses the `char` type, which stores an individual letter as an [ASCII code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII). In other words, it stores a letter as a number. This lets us get a random letter by doing this:

```java
char c = '!';
c += random(93);
```

To understand these lines, take a look at the [printable characters chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters), and notice that `!` is the first printable ascii value, starting with ascii code `33`. There are 93 other printable characters. So adding a random number from 0-93 to the `!` character gives you a random ascii letter!

You could also use the ascii code directly instead of the letter it represents:

```java
char c = 33;
c += random(93);
```

Anyway, this results in a grid of random letters.

## Tweak Ideas
- Change the color of the letters. Make them shades of blue, or randomly colored.
- Base the colors of the letters off something other than random. Make A darker than B darker than C, or make letters at the top red and letters at the bottom blue.
- Change the text size as well as the color. Make letters randomly sized, or make vowels bigger, or make symbols a different size.
- Make upper-case letters one color, lower-case letters a different color, and symbols a third color.
