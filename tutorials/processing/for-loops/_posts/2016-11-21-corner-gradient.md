```java
void setup() {
  size(256, 256);
  noSmooth();
}

void draw() {
  for(int y = 0; y < height; y++){
    for(int x = 0; x < width; x++){
      float distanceFromTopLeft = dist(x, y, 0, 0);
      float distanceFromTopRight = dist(x, y, width, 0);
      float distanceFromBottomLeft = dist(x, y, 0, height);

      stroke(distanceFromTopLeft, distanceFromTopRight, distanceFromBottomLeft);
      point(x, y);
    }
  }
}
```

This code uses nested `for` loops to loop over every pixel in the window. For each pixel, it creates a color based on that pixel's distance from the corners, and then draws the pixel in that color. This creates a corner gradient.

All of the magic happens on these lines:

```java
float distanceFromTopLeft = dist(x, y, 0, 0);
float distanceFromTopRight = dist(x, y, width, 0);
float distanceFromBottomLeft = dist(x, y, 0, height);

stroke(distanceFromTopLeft, distanceFromTopRight, distanceFromBottomLeft);
```

This code uses the `dist()` function to get the distance between each pixel and the top-left, top-right, and bottom-left corners. It then passes those distances into the `stroke()` function, which sets its red, green, and blue components.

Try playing with the parameters passed into the `stroke()` function to come up with different colors, or move the points around to create different types of gradients.

## Tweak Ideas
- Instead of using the corners, use points that bounce around the screen.
- Pass in a random number as one of the parameters to the `stroke()` function.
