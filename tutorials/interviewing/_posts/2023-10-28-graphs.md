You've learned about data structure that are built into Java, and you've learned about node-based data structures that use a `Node` class to model relationships between data.

Specifically, you've seen [linked lists](/tutorials/interviewing/linked-lists), where each node contains a value and points to a single child node:

![Visualization of 4 nodes in a linked list. Each node points to the next node, except for the last node which points to null.](/tutorials/interviewing/images/linked-lists-2.jpg)

You've also seen [trees](/tutorials/interviewing/trees), where each node can point to multiple child nodes:

![visualization of a tree data structure](/tutorials/interviewing/images/trees-2.jpg)

Trees are good for modeling hierarchical data, or decision-making processes. In a tree, nodes have parent-child relationships.

**Graphs** are another node-based data structure, but the relationships between nodes are not hierarchical:

![visualization of a graph containing 7 nodes](/tutorials/interviewing/images/graphs-2.jpg)

In this example, node `A` has three connected sibling nodes `B`, `C`, and `D`. Node `B` has two sibling nodes `A` and `E`. Node `C` has three sibling nodes `A`, `E`, and `F`, and so on.

Graphs can represent interconnected data, or physical spaces like streets or cities. It's common to think about **paths** through graphs. In this example, there are several paths from `A` to `G`:

- `A -> B -> E -> G`
- `A -> C -> E -> G`
- `A -> C -> F -> G`
- `A -> D -> F -> G`

# Connection Costs

In the above example, each node is connected to a set of other nodes. Each connection is yes-or-no: two nodes are either connected, or they're not. Node `A` is connected to nodes `B`, `C`, and `D`, but it's not connected directly to nodes `E`, `F`, or `G`.

A common enhancement to graphs is to include a **cost** (also called a **weight**) for each connection. You can think of this as the distance between two cities, or how much work it takes to get from one condition to the next.

![visualization of a graph containing 7 nodes with costs for each connection](/tutorials/interviewing/images/graphs-3.jpg)

Now each path has an associated cost:

- `A -> B -> E -> G` costs `10`
- `A -> C -> E -> G` costs `12`
- `A -> C -> F -> G` costs `8`
- `A -> D -> F -> G` costs `13`

The exact meaning behind costs depends on the problem. Costs are commonly associated with distance, but you can also think of it as how much work it takes to go from one node to another, or how desirable different paths are. For example, Google Maps sometimes highlights biking paths that might have a longer distance but will require less uphill pedaling.

You can also assign costs or weights to the nodes (also called vertexes) themselves.

# Direction

The above examples assume that if two nodes are connected, they're connected both ways. For example, if `A` is connected to `B`, then `B` is connected to `A`.

That means you can construct longer paths through the graph:

- `A -> B -> E -> C -> F -> G` costs 19
- `A -> D -> F -> C -> E -> G` costs 20

This is called an **undirected** or **bidirectional** graph.

Graphs can also be **directed**, which means connections are one-way. In visualizations, directed connections are often indicated by arrows:

![visualization of a graph containing 7 nodes with directed connections](/tutorials/interviewing/images/graphs-4.jpg)

This example contains a few types of connections:

- One-way (aka directed) connections, like from `A` to `B`
- Two-way (aka undirected or bidirectional) connections, like between `A` and `C`
- Connections with different costs depending on the direction, like how `E` to `G` costs `1` but `G` to `E` costs `4`

Again, the meaning behind directionality in a graph depends on the problem you're solving. You can think of them as one-way streets, or as unreversible decisions.

# Cycles

A path inside a graph is considered a **cycle** if it starts and ends with the same node.

The above example contains a couple cycles:

- `A -> D -> F -> C -> A`
- `C -> F -> G -> E -> C`

Graphs containing cycles are called cyclic graphs, and graphs without cycles are acyclic.

Graphs that contain cycles require some extra care when traversing, to make sure you don't get caught in an infinte loop. More on that below!

# DAGs

Graphs can be directed or undirected, and cyclic or acyclic.

Graphs that are both directed (connections are one-way) and acyclic (no path loops back on itself) are so useful that they have their own nickname: DAG, which stands for directed acyclic graph.

DAGs are graphs that model a hierarchical relationship between data. Does that sound familiar? That's because trees are DAGs, with one extra requirement of each node only having a single parent.

This is a DAG, but not a tree:

![visualization of a DAG, but one node has two parents so it's not a tree](/tutorials/interviewing/images/graphs-5.jpg)

Node `D` has two parent nodes, which means it's not a tree.

This is a tree, which is a specific type of DAG:

![visualization of a DAG](/tutorials/interviewing/images/graphs-6.jpg)

In other words, all trees are DAGs, but not all DAGs are trees.

To go a level deeper, linked lists are also DAGs. In fact, you can think of linked lists as a specific kind of tree where each node only has a single child!

# Graph Representations

So far, we've focused on the concepts behind graphs, but we haven't seen any code yet.

That's because graphs can be represented in a ton of different ways.

You could use a `Node` class:

```java
class Node {
  Object value; // Could be int, String, etc.
  List<Node> neighbors;
}
```

You could also represent costs for each connection:

```java
class Node {
  Object value; // Could be int, String, etc.
  Map<Node, Integer> connections; // Map of neighbors to costs.
}

List<Node> graph;
```

The `Node` class could work for a directed graph, but for a bidirectional graph you'd need to make sure every connection was reflected in both nodes.

Alternatively, you could represent a graph by storing the connections as their own objects:

```java
class Node {
  Object value;
}

class Connection {
  Node one;
  Node two;
}

List<Connection> graph;
```

With that approach, you can also represent directionality and costs by modifying the `Connection` class:

```java
class Connection {
  Node source;
  Node destination;
  int cost;
}
```

# Adjacency Matrixes

The above examples use `Node` or `Connection` classes to represent a graph. These object-based representations are handy if you think in terms of objects!

Another way to represent a graph is with a 2D array, where each row in the array represents the paths from a node to the other nodes in the graph. This is called an adjacency matrix.

In other words, you'd fill out the costs in a table like this:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="visibility: hidden;"></th>
    <th colspan="5">To Node</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="visibility: hidden;"></td>
    <td style="visibility: hidden;"></td>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>D</td>
    <td>E</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="5"
        style="writing-mode: sideways-lr; text-orientation:sideways; width: 25px;">
          From Node
    </th>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>x</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>B</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>x</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>C</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>x</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>D</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>x</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>E</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>x</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Each row in the table represents a different node in the graph, and the cells in the row represent the cost of the connection from that node to another node. This table contains `x` values in the cells that connect a node to itself.

With this approach, your graph is a 2D array:

```java
int[][] graph;
```

Each node in the graph is assigned an index. To check whether node `1` is connected to node `3`, you can look it up in the array:

```java
int costFromNodeOneToNodeThree = graph[1][3];
```

The exact values in the matrix depend on your problem and what type of graph you're working with. You might use `boolean` values instead of costs. You might use `0` to represent a lack of a connection, or you might use infinity or `null`.

# Example Graph

As an example, take this graph:

![visualization of a graph with 5 nodes](/tutorials/interviewing/images/graphs-7.jpg)

This is a directional graph, where each connection has a cost.

You could represent it using a `Node` class:

```java
class Node {
  String name;
  Map<Node, Integer> connections = new HashMap<>();

  public Node(String name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  public addConnection(Node neighbor, int cost){
    connections.put(neighbor, cost);
  }
}

Node a = new Node("A");
Node b = new Node("B");
Node c = new Node("C");
Node d = new Node("D");
Node e = new Node("E");

a.addConnection(b, 5);
a.addConnection(c, 3);
b.addConnection(c, 7);
b.addConnection(d, 2);
c.addConnection(a, 2);
c.addConnection(b, 7);
c.addConnection(e, 1);
d.addConnection(e, 9);
e.addConnection(a, 17);
e.addConnection(d, 9);

List<Node> graph = List.of(a, b, c, d, e);
```

Or you could use a `Connection` class:

```java
class Connection {
  String fromNode; // Could also be a Node class.
  String toNode;
  int cost;

  public Connection(String fromNode, String toNode, int cost) {
    this.fromNode = fromNode;
    this.toNode = toNode;
    this.cost = cost;
  }
}

List<Connection> graph = new ArrayList<>();
graph.add(new Connection("A", "B", 5));
graph.add(new Connection("A", "C", 3));
graph.add(new Connection("B", "C", 7));
graph.add(new Connection("B", "D", 2));
graph.add(new Connection("C", "A", 2));
graph.add(new Connection("C", "B", 7));
graph.add(new Connection("C", "E", 1));
graph.add(new Connection("D", "E", 9));
graph.add(new Connection("E", "A", 17));
graph.add(new Connection("E", "D", 9));
```

Or you could use a table:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="visibility: hidden;"></th>
    <th colspan="5">To Node</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="visibility: hidden;"></td>
    <td style="visibility: hidden;"></td>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>D</td>
    <td>E</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="5"
        style="writing-mode: sideways-lr; text-orientation:sideways; width: 25px;">
          From Node
    </th>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>x</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>∞</td>
    <td>∞</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>∞</td>
    <td>x</td>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>∞</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>x</td>
    <td>∞</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>D</td>
    <td>∞</td>
    <td>∞</td>
    <td>∞</td>
    <td>x</td>
    <td>9</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>E</td>
    <td>17</td>
    <td>∞</td>
    <td>∞</td>
    <td>∞</td>
    <td>x</td>
  </tr>
</table>

```java
int[][] graph = {
  {0, 5, 3, 0, 0},
  {0, 0, 7, 2, 0},
  {2, 7, 0, 0, 1},
  {0, 0, 0, 0, 9},
  {17, 0, 0, 0, 0},
}
```

The important thing to understand is that all of these representations reflect the same underlying graph.

# Graph Algorithms

Graphs are used for many types of problem:

- Pathfinding, like finding a route from one city to another
- Dependency calculation, like checking prerequisites for college courses
- Reasoning about connections, like tracking different groups

These problems generally require building answers by traversing the graph. Similar to trees, you can traverse a graph **depth-first** or **breadth-first**, **recursively** or **iteratively**.

Remember that depth-first search can be implemented recursively or with a stack, and breadth-first search can be implemented using a queue. One catch is that if you're working with a graph that contains cycles, you also need to keep track of the nodes you already visited to avoid infinite loops.

For example, say you wanted to write a function that checks whether a bidirectional graph contains a path from one node to another.

## Depth-First Search with Adjacency Matrix

You could do that with an adjacency matrix:

```java
public boolean containsPath(boolean[][] graph, boolean[] visited, int startNode, int endNode) {
  // ...
}
```

This function takes four arguments:

- `graph` is an adjacency matrix. If `graph[2][3]` is `true`, that means node `2` is connected to node `3`.
- `visited` is an array containing `true` for the node indexes that have already been visited. The first time this function is called, `visited` is filled with `false` values.
- `startNode` is the index of the starting node.
- `endNode` is the index of the ending node.

To implement depth-first search, you could call this function recursively to traverse the graph:

```java
boolean containsPath(boolean[][] graph, boolean[] visited, int source, int destination) {
  // Base case. If the source is the destination, the algorithm has found a path.
  if(source == destination) {
    return true;
  }

  // Base case. If the source was already visited, stop exploring in this direction.
  if(visited[source]) {
    return false;
  }

  // Mark the source node as visited.
  visited[source] = true;

  // Check for connections from source to other nodes.
  for(int i = 0; i < graph[source].length; i++) {
    // If source is connected to node i, try exploring in the direction of node i.
    if(graph[source][i] && validPath(graph, visited, i, destination)) {
      return true;
    }
  }

  // Couldn't find any paths to destination.'
  return false;
}
```

This recursive function has two base cases: one if the `source` and `destination` are equal, and one if `source` has already been visited. Then the code marks the current `source` as visited, and recursively calls the function with every connected neighbor.

Try stepping through this code with a few example graphs!

## Depth-First Search with Nodes

You can also do the same thing with an object-based graph:

```java
class Node {
  int index;
  List<Node> neighbors;
}

boolean containsPath(List<Node> graph, Set<Node> visited, Node source, Node destination) {
  // ...
}
```

Now, instead of an adjacency matrix, the function takes these arguments:

- `graph` is a list of `Node` instances. Each `Node` stores its own connections.
- `visited` is a `Set` that contains the already-visited nodes.
- `source` is the starting node.
- `destination` is the destination node.

The rest of the code is pretty similar to the adjacency matrix function, except now instead of looping through each index in the table row, the code loops through the current node's neighbors:

```java
boolean containsPath(List<Node> graph, Set<Node> visited, Node source, Node destination) {
  // Base case. If the source is the destination, the algorithm has found a path.
  if(source == destination) {
    return true;
  }

  // Base case. If the source was already visited, stop exploring in this direction.
  if(visited.contains(source)) {
    return false;
  }

  // Mark the source node as visited.
  visited.add(source);

  // Explore each connection from the current node.
  for(Node neighbor : source.neighbors) {
    if(validPath(graph, visited, neighbor, destination)) {
      return true;
    }
  }

  // Couldn't find any paths to destination.'
  return false;
}
```

## Breadth-First Search

And here's the same problem, using breadth-first search:

```java
boolean containsPath(List<Node> graph, Node source, Node destination) {
  // Keep track of which nodes were visited already.
  Set<Node> visited = new HashSet<>();

  // Breadth-first search queue of nodes.
  Queue<Node> nodeQueue = new ArrayDeque();
  nodeQueue.add(source);

  while(!nodeQueue.isEmpty()) {
    Node currentNode = nodeQueue.remove();

    // If the current node is the destination, the algorithm found a path.
    if(currentNode == destination) {
      return true;
    }

    // If the current node was already visited, skip it.
    if(visited.contains(currentNode)){
      continue;
    }

    // Mark the current node as visited.
    visited.add(currentNode);

    // Explore the current node's neighbors.
    nodeQueue.addAll(currentNode.neighbors);
  }

  // Couldn't find any paths to destination.'
  return false;
}
```

## Converting Input Data

With graph problems, half of the battle is taking the input data and converting it into a more useable format, like an adjacency matrix or a set of `Node` instances.

For example, this example problem is on Leetcode as [Find if Path Exists in Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-if-path-exists-in-graph/). The input of that function is an array of edges, where each edge connects two node indexes.

```java
public boolean validPath(int n, int[][] edges, int source, int destination) {
  // ...
}
```

By itself, that representation isn't very useful. So the trick to the problem is converting the input into a more useful format.

This example builds an adjacency matrix and then calls the recursive function from above:

```java
public boolean validPathArray(int n, int[][] edges, int source, int destination) {
  // Build an adjacency matrix.
  boolean[][] graph = new boolean[n][n];
  for(int[] edge : edges){
    graph[edge[0]][edge[1]] = true;
    graph[edge[1]][edge[0]] = true;
  }

  // Call the recursive containsPath function.
  return containsPath(graph, new boolean[n], source, destination);        
}
```

This example builds a `List` of `Node` instances and then calls the depth-first search or breadth-first search function from before:

```java
class Node {
  int index;
  List<Node> neighbors = new ArrayList<>();

  public Node(int index) {
    this.index = index;
  }

  public void addNeighbor(Node neighbor){
    neighbors.add(neighbor);
  }
}

public boolean validPath(int n, int[][] edges, int source, int destination) {

  // Build a graph from Node instances.
  List<Node> graph = new ArrayList<>();
  for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    graph.add(new Node(i));
  }

  for(int[] edge : edges){
    graph.get(edge[0]).addNeighbor(graph.get(edge[1]));
    graph.get(edge[1]).addNeighbor(graph.get(edge[0]));
  }

  // Call the rescursive containsPath function.
  return containsPath(graph, new HashSet<>(), graph.get(source), graph.get(destination));
}
```

In an interview environment, if having the graph in a particular format would make your life easier, ask your interviewer if the input can be in that format to start with. The worst case scenario is that they say no, but the best case scenario is that the problem becomes a lot easier to solve!
