This sketch increases the randomness of an image along the Y axis.

I created this for the 19th day of [Genuary](https://genuary2021.github.io/) which had a prompt of “Increase the randomness along the Y-axis.”

# Remix Ideas

- Apply this filter to different images.
- Modify the `getPixelRange()` function to create different effects.
- Instead of picking a random pixel, add randomness to the color of the pixel.
