There are a number of ways to write p5.js code. Which one you choose depends on your personal preferences, but I'll outline a few options here.

# p5.js Online Editor

I personally recommend using the p5.js online editor, especially if you're new to coding. 

To use the p5.js editor, go here: [https://editor.p5js.org/](https://editor.p5js.org/)

You should see something like this:

![p5.js Editor](/tutorials/p5js/images/welcome-to-coding-1.png)

The p5.js editor includes some handy features like syntax highlighting (coloring the text) to make it easier to read your code, and a play button (the triangle button in the upper-left corner) to make it easier to run your code.

The p5.js editor also lets you write HMTL and JavaScript directly in your browser. Check out this tutorial to learn more:

The p5.js online editor is great if you want a self-contained editor and don't mind relying on an internet connection. You can also login to save your sketches, and share your work as a webpage!

# Text Editors

If you'd prefer to edit the code on your own computer (for example, if you don't have a reliable internet connection), then you can use any text editor. You can use whatever text editor came with your computer (Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on Mac), or you can download something like [jEdit](http://www.jedit.org/) or [NotePad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). I personally use jEdit, but you should try a few out and see which one you like best.

You **don't** want to use a rich text editor like Word though, because they introduce extra formatting that will break your code. You can also try googling "code editors" for some other options.

If you're using a text editor, you'll want to first create an `.html` file that loads the p5.js library and contains your code. Here's an example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>P5.js Example</title>
		<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/0.5.14/p5.js"></script>
		<script>
			function setup(){
				createCanvas(500, 500);
				background(64);
			}
			
			function draw(){
				fill(255);
				ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 20, 20);
			}
		</script>
	</head>
	<body>
	</body>
</html>
```

To run your code, open the file with your web browser. You can right-click the file and then go to `Open With...` and choose your web browser, or you can type the file's location directly in the URL bar. For example, my file is named `index.html` and it's saved on my desktop, so my file's URL is:

```
file:///C:/Users/kevin/Desktop/index.html
```

When you open your file in your browser, you should see something like this:

![P5.js Example](/tutorials/p5js/images/editors-1.png)

Try changing the `fill(255);` line to be `fill(255, 0, 0);` and then save the file and refresh the page. You should see red circles instead of white.

Note that you can also save your p5.js code to a separate file, for example `sketch.js`. Then in your `index.html` file, you'd load that file using `<script src="sketch.js"></sketch>`.

Using a text editor is great if you want full control over everything. It also lets you work on your code without an internet connection, as long as you download a local copy of p5.js instead of using the CDNJS link.

# Processing Editor

You can also create p5.js sketches from the Processing editor. Go to the mode dropdown in the upper-right corner (by default it says `Java`), and then click `Add Mode...`. In the Contribution Manager dialog that pops up, click `p5.js Mode` and then click the `Install` button in the lower-right corner.

![Install P5.js mode](/tutorials/p5js/images/editors-5.png)

When the download and install finishes, close the Contribution Manager dialog.

Then click the mode dropdown again (it probably still says `Java`) and then click `p5.js`. You should see this:

![Processing editor P5.js mode](/tutorials/p5js/images/editors-6.png)

Try typing this into the editor:

```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  background(64);
}

function draw() {
  circle(mouseX, mouseY, 50);
}
```

Then click the play button, and the Processing editor should automatically open your web browser to a local server that Processing is running for you. You should see something like this:

![P5.js local server](/tutorials/p5js/images/editors-7.png)

You can edit the `index.html` tab to change what's displayed around your sketch. Try adding `<h1>Hello World</h1>` to the `<body>` of your HTML, and click the run button again.

You can save you sketch to see the files you're working with. I saved my sketch to my desktop and named it `MySketch`, which created a directory named `MySketch` on my desktop. In that directory, I see an `index.html` file and a `MySketch.js` file, as well as a `libraries` directory that contains a `p5.js` file. These are all regular text files that will work with any of the editors in this tutorial.

The Processing editor is a good choice if you've already been using it to write Processing code, or if you need an easy way to launch a local server (some features don't work with `file://` URLs, so you need a server).

# CodePen

CodePen is another online editor that lets you to write HTML and JavaScript directly in your browser.

Go to [https://codepen.io/](https://codepen.io/) and then click the `Create` button, and then the `New Pen` button. That takes you to the CodePen editor.

From there, go to the `Settings` button and click the `JavaScript` tab. In the `Add External JavaScript` section, you want to add p5.js. Go to [the p5.js CDN page](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/p5.js) to find the latest version of p5.js, and paste that URL into the `Add External JavaScript` section of the CodePen settings dialog. It should look like this:

![CodePen settings](/tutorials/p5js/images/editors-8.png)

Then click the `Close` button, and type this into the JavaScript section of the editor:

```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);
  background(64);
}

function draw() {
  circle(mouseX, mouseY, 50);
}
```

You should see something like this:

{% include codepen-new.html slug-hash="WZoxaB" height="300" %}

(Click the `Run Pen` button to see the embedded CodePen editor.)

# JavaScript Console

All of the above options involve running code in a web browser. Before you start coding, make sure you're familiar with the JavaScript console! This will be your best friend when debugging your code.

Check out the [debugging tutorial](/tutorials/p5js/debugging) and the [developer tools tutorial](/tutorials/javascript/developer-tools) to learn more.

If you encounter a situation where your code is doing something different from what you expected, check the JavaScript console for errors.

# Summary

These are a few examples of p5.js editors, but there are a bunch of other options. For example, [OpenProcessing](https://www.openprocessing.org/) is an online editor and community built around Processing and p5.js, and [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) is another text editor. The best advice I can give you is to try a bunch of different options out and see which one you like the best.

No matter what you choose, the fundamental steps are the same: you create an HTML file that loads p5.js (which is a JavaScript library), optionally add files (like images or other libraries), and then run your code in a web browser. And don't forget to check the JavaScript console for errors!
