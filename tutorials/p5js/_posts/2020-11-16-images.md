{% include toc.md %}

Now you know how to [use objects](/tutorials/p5js/using-objects) and [create your own classes](/tutorials/p5js/creating-classes). You know how to create an **instance** of a class, store it in a variable, and then call functions belonging to that instance.

For example, you've seen the predefined `p5.Vector` class:

{% include p5js-widget.html width=300 height=300 %}
let myCircle;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);
  myCircle = new p5.Vector(100, 100);
  myCircle.add(25, 50);
}

function draw() {
  background(50);
  circle(myCircle.x, myCircle.y, 100);
}
</script>

p5.js offers several other predefined classes. One of them is the `p5.Image` class, which lets you load, display, and manipulate image files.

# Adding Files to Your Sketch

Before you can use an image file in your code, you have to add it to your sketch.

If you're using the [p5.js web editor](https://editor.p5js.org/):

1. Click the `>` button just under the play button to expand the list of files in your sketch. You should see `index.html`, `sketch.js`, and `style.css`.
2. Click the dropdown menu next to `Sketch Files` and then click `Upload file`.
3. In the window that pops up, drag a file or click to select a file.
4. When your file is done uploading, close the file selector window.

You should now see your image file in the list of `Sketch Files`. You can collapse the list of sketch files by clicking the `<` button.

# Loading Images

After you've added an image file to your sketch, you can call the `loadImage()` function to create an instance of the `p5.Image` class.

For example, if you have an image file named `stanley.jpg`, you can create an instance of `p5.Image` like this:

```java
let stanleyImage = loadImage("stanley.jpg");
```

You can also reference an image on the internet using its URL:

```java
let stanleyImage = loadImage("https://happycoding.io/images/stanley-1.jpg");
```

# Drawing Images

Now that you have an instance of `PImage` stored in a variable, you can display it by calling the `image()` function.

The `image()` function takes three parameters: an instance of `PImage` and `x` and `y` coordinates that tell Processing where to draw the image.

{% include p5js-widget.html width=300 height=300 %}
let img;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);
  img = loadImage('https://happycoding.io/images/stanley-1.jpg');
}

function draw() {
  image(img, 0, 0);
}
</script>

![picture of Stanley](/tutorials/p5js/images/images-2.jpg)

The `image()` function is just like the other drawing functions you've already seen, like the `rect()` and `circle()` functions. Try experimenting with different x and y parameters!

{% include p5js-widget.html width=300 height=300 %}
let img;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);
  img = loadImage('https://happycoding.io/images/stanley-1.jpg');
}

function draw() {
  image(img, mouseX, mouseY);
}
</script>

![image following mouse](/tutorials/processing/images/images-3.gif)

Note that these sketches **declare** the `img` variable at the top of the sketch, then **initialize** it inside the `setup()` function, and then display it in the `draw()` function. You should follow this pattern with your images as well. If you load your image in the `draw()` function, you'd be reading the same file 60 times every second, which could slow your program down or even cause it to crash.

**Remember:** declare your images at the top of the sketch, load them in `setup()`, and display them in `draw()`.

# Resizing Images

The `p5.Image` class contains several useful functions that let you manipulate images. For example, the `resize()` function resizes an image. Here's an example that resizes the image whenever the user clicks the mouse:

{% include p5js-widget.html width=300 height=300 %}
let img;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);
  //img = loadImage("stanley.jpg");
  img = loadImage('https://happycoding.io/images/stanley-1.jpg');
}

function draw() {
  image(img, 0, 0);
}

function mousePressed() {
  img.resize(mouseX, mouseY);
}
</script>

![resizing image](/tutorials/processing/images/images-4.gif)

This is useful if you're loading a large image and want to display it smaller.

Note that this only changes the size of the instance, not the file itself.

# The p5.Color Class

The next few sections use a class you might not have seen before: the `p5.Color` class!

The `p5.Color` class represents an R, G, B color. You can create a `color` using the `color()` function. Then when you have a `color` value, you can pass it into any function that also takes R, G, B arguments.

{% include p5js-widget.html width=300 height=300 %}
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);
}

function draw() {
  let magenta = color(255, 0, 255);
  background(magenta);

  let cyan = color(0, 255, 255);
  fill(cyan);
  rect(100, 100, 100, 100);
}
</script>

![colored squares](/tutorials/processing/images/images-9.png)

To convert from a `p5.Color` to individual R, G, and B, values, you can use the `red()`, `green()`, and `blue()` functions which take a `p5.Color` argument and return the corresponding R, G, or B value.

I personally avoid the `p5.Color` class because I prefer working with separate R, G, and B values. But the next few functions *only* work with the `p5.Color` type!

# Getting Pixels

After you load an image, you can get the color of an individual pixel by calling the `get()` function.

Here's an example:

{% include p5js-widget.html width=300 height=300 %}
let img;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);
  img = loadImage('https://happycoding.io/images/stanley-1.jpg');
}

function draw() {
  image(img, 0, 0);

  // Get the color at the mouse position
  let c = img.get(mouseX, mouseY);

  // Change the fill to that color
  fill(c);

  // Draw a square with that color
  square(mouseX, mouseY, 50);
}
</script>

![sketch showing pixel color](/tutorials/processing/images/images-5.gif)

This program uses the `get()` function to get the color of the pixel that's under the cursor's position, then displays a box showing that color. Think of it like a magnifying glass that shows you the pixel under the mouse.

# Setting Pixels

Just like you can get the color of a specific pixel using the `get()` function, you can also set the color of a specific pixel using the `loadPixels()`, `set()`, and `updatePixels()` functions. Here's an example that turns a random pixel black every frame:

{% include p5js-widget.html width=300 height=300 %}
let img;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);
  img = loadImage("https://happycoding.io/images/stanley-1.jpg");
}

function draw() {
  // Get a random position in the image
  let x = floor(random(img.width));
  let y = floor(random(img.height));

  // Set that pixel to black
  let black = color(0);
  img.loadPixels();
  img.set(x, y, black);
  img.updatePixels();

  image(img, 0, 0);
}
</script>

![image getting darker](/tutorials/processing/images/images-6.gif)

The `loadPixels()` function tells p5.js to prepare the image's pixels for changing, the `set()` function changes the color of a specific pixel, and the `updatePixels()` function tells p5.js to update the image with its new pixels.

# Preloading Images

So far, the examples have loaded the images from the `setup()` function. That will work as long as you don't need to use the image right away. But you're going to have a problem if you do need to use the image right away, like if you need to get its width and height, or if you need to modify the pixels in the `setup()` function.

The `loadImage()` function is *asynchronous*, which means that the rest of the code keeps running while the image loads behind the scenes. This helps your sketch load faster, because it doesn't have to wait until all of the images are loaded to start running.

But if you try to use the image right after you call `loadImage()`, but before the image is actually loaded, then it won't work.

Here's an example:

{% include p5js-widget.html width=300 height=300 %}
let img;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);
  img = loadImage('https://happycoding.io/images/stanley-1.jpg');
  image(img, 0, 0);
}

function draw() {
  circle(mouseX, mouseY, 50);
}
</script>

You might expect this code to show an image and then draw circles on top of that image. But if you run it, you'll see that the image is not drawn! That's because the image is not done loading when the code tries to draw it.

You can use the `preload()` function to fix this problem. The `preload()` function is called automatically, just before the `setup()` function. Any images loaded from inside the `preload()` function will be loaded **before** the sketch starts running. This means you might see a `"Loading..."` message when your sketch first starts, but it also means you can use your images right away.

{% include p5js-widget.html width=300 height=300 %}
let img;

function preload() {
  img = loadImage("https://happycoding.io/images/stanley-1.jpg");
}

function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 300);

  img.resize(100, 100);

  img.loadPixels();
  // Loop over every pixel in the image
  for (let y = 0; y < img.height; y++) {
    for (let x = 0; x < img.width; x++) {
      // Read the pixel's color
      let originalColor = img.get(x, y);

      // Inverse the color
      const r = 255 - red(originalColor);
      const g = 255 - green(originalColor);
      const b = 255 - blue(originalColor);
      let outputColor = color(r, g, b);

      // Set the pixel's color
      img.set(x, y, outputColor);
    }
  }
  img.updatePixels();
}

function draw() {
  image(img, 0, 0, width, height);
}
</script>

![inversed image](/tutorials/processing/images/images-7.png)

This code might seem complicated, but try to read through it one line at a time.

This line loops over every row in the image:

```javascript
for(let y = 0; y < img.height; y++) {
```

For each row, this line loops over each column in that row:

```javascript
for(let x = 0; x < img.width; x++) {
```

Given a row and a column (in other words, a `y` and an `x`), this line gets the color of that pixel:

```javascript
color originalColor = img.get(x, y);
```

Now that you have the pixel's color, you can inverse that color by subtracting the R, G, and B components from 255:

```javascript
const r = 255 - red(originalColor);
const g = 255 - green(originalColor);
const b = 255 - blue(originalColor);
let outputColor = color(r, g, b);
```

If this part is confusing, try writing down some example colors and doing this math to see how it creates the inverse!

Finally, this line sets the color of the pixel to the newly calculated color:

```javascript
img.set(x, y, outputColor);
```

Try modifying the logic to swap the blue and green of each pixel, or to divide the red by two, or to rearrange the pixels.

# Other Image Functions

The `p5.Image` class contains several other useful functions. Check out [the reference](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Image) for more info about them. Don't be afraid to experiment!

# Homework

- Take a colored image and display it as black and white.
- Take a black and white image and display it in color. Don't worry too much about getting the colors correct!
- Show a character that walks around when you press the arrow keys. Use different images for the different poses.
- Take an image and apply a custom filter to it.
- Resize an image to display in the `width` and `height` of the window while maintaining its aspect ratio. Tall image should show a border on the left and right. Wide images should show a border on the top and bottom.
