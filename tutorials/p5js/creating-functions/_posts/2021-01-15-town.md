This sketch defines a `drawTown()` function that calls the `drawBlock()` function four times, and the `drawBlock()` function calls the `drawHouse()` function four times.

# Remix Ideas

- Add some variety: give every house a random color.
- Make some of the houses skyscrapers, or schools, or gardens.
- Try different patterns: maybe your block only has 3 houses, or maybe your town has 6 blocks.
