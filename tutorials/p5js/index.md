# p5.js Tutorials

p5.js is a coding language for making creative, animated, interactive, and artistic projects. It's designed for folks who are new to coding, so it's the perfect place to start. It's also built on top of JavaScript, so it's a great way to learn the fundamentals of coding, even if your eventual goal is to learn other languages.
