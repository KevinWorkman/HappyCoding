This is part of [p5 spooky sketches printout](http://tinyurl.com/p5-spooky-sketches) I made for [CC Fest](http://ccfest.rocks/) in 2019. That printout contains a bunch of Halloween-themed examples of drawing and image manipulation. Feel free to use it on your own or in a classroom!

# Remix Ideas

- Change the size of your pumpkin.
- Change the color of a pumpkin.
- Draw a face on your pumpkin to make a Jack-o'-lantern!
- Make other Halloween decorations, like gourds or ghosts!
