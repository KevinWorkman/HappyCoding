# JavaScript Tutorials

At this point, you're familiar with the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. (If not, read through the [HTML tutorials](/tutorials/html) and then come back!) You know that HTML lets you write the content for your webpage, and CSS lets you style that content. JavaScript lets you make your webpages **interactive**.

Read through these tutorials to learn more about JavaScript:

<div class="thumbnail-link-container">
{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/javascript/calling-javascript" %}
{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/javascript/variables" %}
{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/javascript/developer-tools" %}
{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/javascript/creating-functions" %}
{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/javascript/interactive-html" %}
{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/javascript/libraries" %}
{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/javascript/fetch" %}
</div>

# Legacy Tutorials

I wrote these tutorials back in 2017. Since then, I've personally stopped using jQuery and Bootstrap, and the `fetch()` function replaced a lot of what's in the old AJAX tutorial. They're still here if you want to learn them, but I recommend using vanilla JavaScript and CSS instead!

<div class="thumbnail-link-container">
{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/javascript/ajax" %}
{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/javascript/jquery" %}
{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/javascript/bootstrap" %}
</div>
