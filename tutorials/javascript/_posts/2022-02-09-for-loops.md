Now you know the fundamentals of JavaScript. You've created variables and functions, and you've used `if` statements to conditionally take different actions in your code.

This tutorial introduces `for` loops, which let you repeat code multiple times.

# For Loop Syntax

To create a `for` loop, first type the `for` keyword, and then in parentheses `()` provide three things:

- Declare a variable to keep track of how many times you've looped, and initialize it to a number (usually 0): `let index = 0;`
- Write a test that evaluates to a boolean value of `false` whenever the loop should stop: `index < 10;`
- Reassign the variable so that it increases after each loop: `index = index + 1;` (which can be shortened to `index++`)

Then inside curly brackets `{}`, write the code that you want to repeat. Putting it all together, it looks like this:

{% include codepen-new.html slug-hash="abVWbaY" height="175" autoplay=true %}

# Repeating Code

The `for` loop syntax is new, so let's talk about how to read it.

```javascript
for (let index = 0; index < 10; index++) {
  document.write('<p>index: ' + index + '</p>');
}
```

Like all other code, the best way to read a `for` loop is line-by-line. The first line is doing a few things, so you might introduce some white space to make it easier to read:

```javascript
for (
     let index = 0;
     index < 10;
     index++
  ) {
  document.write('<p>index: ' + index + '</p>');
}
```

1. First, the `for` keyword tells you that the code is going to loop a certain number of times.
2. Then the `let index = 0;` part tells you the loop index will start at zero.
3. Then the `index < 10` part tells you that the loop will continue until index reaches 10.
4. Then the `index++` part tells you that the loop variable increases by `1` each time the code loops.
5. Finally, the `document.write('<p>index: ' + index + '</p>');` line prints some content to the page

Now this is where `for` loops get interesting: when the code reaches the end of the loop, first it runs the `index++` part, and then it starts back over at the top! Then it checks the `index < 10` part, and if it's still true, it runs the loop again. This process repeats until `index < 10` evaluates to false, at which point the code skips to the bottom of the loop and keeps going.

# Indexing and Incrementing

The above example starts the loop variable at `0`. This is very common (and you'll see why when you learn about arrays), but keep in mind that you can start your loop at any value you want.

{% include codepen-new.html slug-hash="vYWmEXY" height="200" autoplay=true %}

This code starts the loop at `7`, and keeps looping until the loop variable exceeds `77`. It also increases the loop `variable` by `7` after each iteration of the loop.

# Homework

- Create a webpage with a number input. When the user enters a number, print out the lyrics to [the song that never ends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Song_That_Never_Ends) that many times.
- Create a webpage that shows the lyrics to [99 bottles of beer on the wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99_Bottles_of_Beer).
