Now you know how to create webpages using HTML, and you know how to make them interactive using JavaScript.

Let's say you have a few pages: a homepage, an about page, and a page that shows pictures of cats. Now you want to show a welcome message on every page. In other words, you want to add this at the top of each `.html` file:

```html
<p>Welcome to my website!</p>
```

You could do this manually by editing each `.html` file and copying this into it. That might be okay for three files, but what if you have a dozen pages? Or a hundred? What happens when you want to change the message to something else?

It would be nice if you could put your message in a single place that every `.html` file reads from. Then when you want to change the message, you could change it in one place instead of changing it in each individual file.

There are a few ways to do that: you could write JavaScript that [manipulates the page](/html/javascript/interactive-html), or you could use something like [Jekyll](/tutorials/html/jekyll) or a [server](/tutorials/java-server) to build the HTML.

This tutorial introduces another approach called AJAX, which you can implement using the `fetch()` function.

# AJAX

AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. That sounds complicated, but with modern JavaScript, using AJAX means calling the `fetch()` function. This function lets you load an external file and add its content to your webpage.

(You can do a lot more than that with the `fetch()` function, but let's work our way up from the fundamentals!)

# No Local Files

The `fetch()` function lets you load other files on the internet, but it does not work with local files loaded using `file://` URLs. This is a safety feature. Imagine how scary the internet would be if any website could read files from your computer!

But this might also make it more annoying to out your code as you read through this tutorial. To make your life a little easier, you can use these files for now:

- [http://HappyCoding.io/tutorials/javascript/example-ajax-files/text-welcome.txt](/tutorials/javascript/example-ajax-files/text-welcome.txt)
- [http://HappyCoding.io/tutorials/javascript/example-ajax-files/html-welcome.html](/tutorials/javascript/example-ajax-files/html-welcome.html)
- [http://HappyCoding.io/tutorials/javascript/example-ajax-files/random-welcomes.json](/tutorials/javascript/example-ajax-files/random-welcomes.json)

You can also use your own files, but you have to either run a local server (like [Jekyll](/tutorials/html/jekyll)) or upload them to a web host.

Anyway, back to the tutorial!

# Fetch with Async and Await

Here's an example that uses the `fetch()` function to fetch the content at a URL, read the text from the response, and then modify the page using that text.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<script>
    async function fetchWelcome() {
      // Fetch the content from the URL
      const fetchResponse = await   fetch('https://happycoding.io/tutorials/javascript/example-ajax-files/text-welcome.txt');

      // Read the text content of the response
      const text = await fetchResponse.text();

      // Use the text to modify the page
      document.getElementById('welcome-container').innerText = text;
    }
  </script>
</head>
<body onload="fetchWelcome()">
  <div id="welcome-container"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

This example uses **async and await** because the `fetch()` function is asynchronous. If you're not familiar with those concepts, I'd recommend reading up on them before you try to use the `fetch()` function. Try searching for terms like "JavaScript async and await" for a ton of results, and check out [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Async_await) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_async.asp) for more info.

But the fundamentals of `fetch()` are three things:

1. Calling the `fetch()` function to request a specific URL:

   ```javascript
   const fetchResponse = await   fetch('https://happycoding.io/tutorials/javascript/example-ajax-files/text-welcome.txt');
   ```

2. Reading the content of the response:

   ```javascript
   const text = await fetchResponse.text();
   ```

3. Doing something with the content of the response:

   ```javascript
   document.getElementById('welcome-container').innerText = text;
   ```

You can also collapse the first two steps into a single line of code:

```javascript
 const text = await (await fetch('https://happycoding.io/tutorials/javascript/example-ajax-files/text-welcome.txt')).text();
```

I find this syntax confusing, so I tend to keep them as separate lines, but this shows you the power of the `fetch()` function: one line of code to fetch the content of another URL!

# Fetch with Promise Chaining

The above example used `async` and `await` to fetch the response and read it, but another common way to use the `fetch()` function is with **promise chaining**.

Here's an example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<script>
    function fetchWelcome() {
      // Fetch the content from the URL
      fetch('https://happycoding.io/tutorials/javascript/example-ajax-files/text-welcome.txt')
      // Read the text content of the response
      .then(response => response.text())
      // Use the text to modify the page
      .then((text) => {
        document.getElementById('welcome-container').innerText = text;
      });
    }
  </script>
</head>
<body onload="fetchWelcome()">
  <div id="welcome-container"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

This code does the same thing as the above async / await example, but it uses promise chaining instead. If you're not familiar with promises, try searching for "JavaScript promises" for more information, and check out [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises) and [W3Schoosl](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_promise.asp) to learn more.

Async / await and promises are two different ways to work with asynchronous functions, so you should use whichever one makes more sense in your brain!

# JSON

Let's pause talking about the `fetch()` function for a second and talk about something else: JSON.

Remember that you can use object literals to represent objects in JavaScript:

```javascript
const point = {x: 7, y: 42};

console.log("The point is at " + point.x + ", " + point.y);
```

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it's a way to store data in a way that's easy for JavaScript to understand. For example, here's the same object stored as JSON in a string variable:

```javascript
const jsonString = '{"x": 7, "y": 42}';
```

If this looks weird, remember that JavaScript uses both single quotes `'` and double quotes `"` for strings. So this is a string (characters inside single quotes `'`), and that string contains some double quote `"` characters.

But the string is in the JSON format, which looks a lot like an object literal, except the variable names are surrounded by double quote `"` characters. (Actually you can do that with object literals too!)

Now that you have a JSON string, you can use the `JSON.parse()` function to turn it into a JavaScript object that you can use in your code:

```javascript
const jsonString = '{"x": 7, "y": 42}';
const point = JSON.parse(jsonString);

console.log("The point is at " + point.x + ", " + point.y);
```

## JSON Arrays

You can also use JSON to store arrays. To store an array in JSON, use square brackets `[ ]` and a comma-separated list of JSON objects, like this:

```javascript
const jsonArrayString = '[ {"x": 7, "y": 42}, {"x": 0, "y": 0}, {"x": 2.7, "y": 3.14} ]';
```

This JSON string represents an array that contains 3 objects with `x` and `y` properties. You can use the `JSON.parse()` function to turn this into an array that you can use in your code, just like any other array:

```javascript
const jsonArrayString = '[ {"x": 7, "y": 42}, {"x": 0, "y": 0}, {"x": 2.7, "y": 3.14} ]';
const pointArray = JSON.parse(jsonArrayString);
for(const point of pointArray){	
	console.log("The point is at " + point.x + ", " + point.y);
}
```

## Nested JSON

One more note about JSON: most of the JSON you'll see in real life will be more complicated than these examples. Just like object literals can contain other object literals and arrays, JSON can contain nested data.

For example, here is a JSON array that contains objects, which themselves contain objects and arrays:


```javascript
'[
	{
		"name": "Example One",
		"numbers": [1, 2, 3],
		"point": {"x":7, "y":42}
	},
	
	{
		"name": "Example Two",
		"numbers": [4, 5, 6],
		"point": {"x":2.7, "y":3.14}
	}
]'
```

This example JSON represents an array that contains two objects. Each object has three properties: a `name` property that points to a string value, a `numbers` property that points to an array, and a `point` property that points to an object.

You could use the `JSON.parse()` function to turn this JSON into an array, and then you could use JavaScript to get at the data in this JSON. For example, this line would print out the point of the first object:

```javascript
const parsedArray = JSON.parse(jsonArray);
const firstPoint = parsedArray[0].point;
console.log("The first point is at " + firstPoint.x + ", " + firstPoint.y);
```

# Fetch with JSON

Why are we talking about JSON? Because you can use the `fetch()` function to load JSON data..

For example, take a look at the JSON file here: [http://happycoding.io/tutorials/javascript/example-ajax-files/random-welcomes.json](http://happycoding.io/tutorials/javascript/example-ajax-files/random-welcomes.json)

```json
[
  {"text": "Welcome to my site!", "color": "red"},
  {"text": "Thanks for visiting!", "color": "blue"},
  {"text": "Hello visitor!", "color": "green"},
  {"text": "Meow!", "color": "orange"},
  {"text": "Bienvenido!", "color": "purple"}
]
```

This JSON file contains an array which contains 5 objects. Each of those objects contains a `text` property and a `color` property.

You can write code that uses the `fetch()` function to request this URL, and then you can use the `json()` function to read the JSON from the response, which gives you an object that you can manipulate in our code.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<script>
    async function fetchWelcome() {
      // Fetch the content from the URL
      const fetchResponse = await   fetch('https://happycoding.io/tutorials/javascript/example-ajax-files/random-welcomes.json');

      // Read the JSON content of the response and parse it to get an array
      const messagesArray = await fetchResponse.json();

      // Pick a random message from the array
      const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random()*messagesArray.length);
      const message = messagesArray[randomIndex];

      // Use that message to set content and color
      const welcomeContainer = document.getElementById("welcome-container");
      welcomeContainer.innerText = message.text;
      welcomeContainer.style.color = message.color;
    }
  </script>
</head>
<body onload="fetchWelcome()">
  <div id="welcome-container"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

This code fetches the JSON from the file and then parses that JSON into an array using the `json()` function. Then the code picks a random message, and uses it to set the content and color of the page.

In other words, this code displays a random welcome message (which are specified in a separate `.json` file) at the top of the webpage:

{% include codepen-new.html slug-hash="YzNqvoo" height="475" %}

(Try refreshing this example to see different welcome messages.)

# Thinking in AJAX

Before AJAX, most websites worked like this:

- A visitor goes to a URL that points to a particular `.html` file.
- That `.html` file contains all of the content on the page, and it's loaded all at once. (The page might also load other files like JavaScript and CSS, but it's all referenced by the HTML file.)
- To visit another page on the website, the visitor goes to a different URL that points to a different `.html` file.
- That next `.html` file contains all of the content on the next page, and it's also loaded all at once.
- Repeat.

This is exactly how the pages you've created have worked so far, and it's how many static websites still work.

But as webpages became more complicated and contained more data, pages started taking longer to load, which made it harder for webpages to be interactive.

AJAX was developed to deal with these issues. Using AJAX, a website can work like this:

- A visitor goes to a URL that points to a particular `.html` file.
- That `.html` file contains the "core content" of a page, like its overall layout and some JavaScript for fetching additional content.
- Then the webpage makes a bunch of smaller AJAX requests to fetch the additional content.
- To visit another page section on the website, the visitor clicks a button that triggers AJAX to load just that section, without reloading stuff like the navigation bar. (JavaScript can change what's in the URL bar, so it might even look like you're visiting another page!)

This was a different way of thinking about how webpages work. It lets sites like Gmail (which was one of the first popular pages to use AJAX) load only the layout of the page at first, then to fetch the messages, then to fetch their content. It lets sites like Twitter or Facebook implement an "infinite scroll" that loads more content as you scroll through your feed. It also enabled features like notifications and autocomplete!

But AJAX is not an all-or-nothing thing. You don't **have** to use AJAX, but it can be very useful for loading "extra content" on top of your webpage. This is called [progressive enhancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement), where you guarantee that your page will work without JavaScript, and then you use AJAX to add extras.

You can see AJAX in action yourself: look for websites that only reload parts of their UI when you click around. For example, when you click on a tweet in Twitter, the whole page doesn't reload. The navigation stays in place, and only the central content of the page changes. That's because Twitter is using AJAX!

## Homework

- Create your own `.json` file that contains welcome messages, and use AJAX to show a random welcome message (or quote of the day, or cat facts) on every page on your site.
- I provide a `.json` file located at [http://happycoding.io/api/site.json](http://happycoding.io/api/site.json) that contains JSON that represents every post on this site. Do something cool with it! (For example, the [tags](/tags) page is built using AJAX and this file!) I'd love to see anything you come up with!
- CodePen also provides files that can be fetched with AJAX. Read more about it [here](https://blog.codepen.io/2013/09/23/ajax-codepen/). Do something cool!
