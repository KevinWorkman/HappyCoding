This example uses the [Google Maps JavaScript library](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial) to create a tour of some of my favorite places in Washington DC. If you ever visit, check them out!

Here's the source code that created this map:

      };

      map = new google.maps.Map(element, mapOptions);

      for(var i = 0; i < places.length; i++){

    function addPlace(place){
      var marker = new google.maps.Marker({
        position: place,
        map: map
      });

      marker.addListener('click', function() {
        document.getElementById("title").innerHTML = place.title;
        document.getElementById("description").innerHTML = place.description;
      });

    #map{

<body onload="createMap()">

</html>
```

First I load the Google Maps JavaScript library, and then I create an array of object literals that contain `lat`, `lng`, `title`, and `description` fields. I create the map, and then I loop over that array to add a marker for each place.

Check out this line of code:

```javascript
var marker = new google.maps.Marker({
  position: place,
  map: map
});
```

Notice that I pass the `place` directly into the `Marker` constructor. This is because my place objects all have a `lat` and a `lng` field, which means they can work as positions! This is an example of **duck typing** that we talked about in the [Creating JavaScript Objects](/tutorials/javascript/creating-objects) tutorial.

I then add a click listener to each marker, so when the user clicks I update the title and description elements based on what's in the place object. Enjoy the tour!

## Tweak Ideas

- Make a tour of your own town.
- Add pictures of each place!
- Instead of tossing markers on a map, create an itinerary and a walking (or driving) path that you show on the map.
- You could also work in street view, 45 degree tilt, or other Google Maps features.
