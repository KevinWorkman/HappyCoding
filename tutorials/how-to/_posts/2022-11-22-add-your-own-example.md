I absolutely **love** when folks make their own projects based on concepts they learned from Happy Coding, or when folks remix my code to create their own take.

I'd love to start linking to user-submitted projects, and this tutorial introduces a couple ways to do that.

# The Forum

The easiest way to show off your project is to post it on [the Happy Coding forum](https://forum.happycoding.io).

Every tutorial and example page has a corresponding post on the forum. Replies to that post will show as comments on the original Happy Coding page. So if you're posting a remix to an existing tutorial or example, that's one way to do it!

You can also feel free to create your own new post. I read every post on the forum, so either way I'll see it!

# GitHub

Happy Coding is open source, and all of its code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/KevinWorkman/HappyCoding).

If you're comfortable with GitHub and GitHub Pages, you can create a **pull request** that adds your example as a sub-page of a tutorial.

You can learn more in the [GitHub Pages tutorial](/tutorials/html/github-pages). And if this feels overwhelming, that's okay! You can always post in the forum and I'll be happy to help you through the process.
