So far we've learned how to draw shapes using libGDX. This is good for simple games and for certain kinds of visualizations. But most "real" games will use images for most of their graphics. This tutorial goes over loading image files, rendering them as textures, and using sprite batching to handle many images at once.

# Image Files

Remember that a libGDX project is usually a few different subprojects: a core project that contains the game's main code, and then platform projects that contain platform-specific wrappers of the core project, which allow you to deploy to multiple platforms. For example you might have an Android project, a web project, and a desktop project in addition to the core project.

LibGDX expects images and other files to be in different places depending on your project setup:

- If you have an Android project, put your images inside the `assets` directory inside your Android project.
- If you do not have an Android project, put your images inside the `assets` directory inside your core project.

For example, if I'm planning on deploying to Android and web, I'll have three projects: core, Android, and web. My images will be in the `assets` directory inside my Android project. Note that the images will be copied automatically into the web project when I deploy it, so I don't have to copy them manually myself.

# Loading Textures

The `Texture` class represents an image file that's been loaded into memory to be drawn onto the screen.

To load a texture, you can call the `Gdx.files.internal()` function to load the image file, and pass that into the `Texture` constructor:

```java
Texture texture = new Texture(Gdx.files.internal("my-image.png"));
```

Our `texture` variable is now ready to be drawn to the screen.

# Drawing Textures

To draw a texture to the screen, first we have to create a `SpriteBatch` object:

```java
SpriteBatch batch = new SpriteBatch();
```

Then we can call the `batch.draw()` function to draw our texture:

```java
batch.begin();
batch.draw(texture, 0, 0);
batch.end();
```

Make sure to include the calls to the `batch.begin()` and `batch.end()` functions.

Putting it all together, it looks like this:

```java
package io.happycoding.helloworld;

import com.badlogic.gdx.ApplicationAdapter;
import com.badlogic.gdx.Gdx;
import com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.GL20;
import com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.Texture;
import com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g2d.SpriteBatch;

public class HelloWorldGame extends ApplicationAdapter {

    SpriteBatch batch;
    Texture texture;

    public void create () {
        batch = new SpriteBatch();
        texture = new Texture(Gdx.files.internal("stanley-1.png"));
    }

    public void render () {
        Gdx.gl.glClearColor(.25f, .25f, .25f, 1);
        Gdx.gl.glClear(GL20.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

        batch.begin();
        batch.draw(texture, 0, 0);
        batch.end();
    }

    @Override
    public void dispose() {
        batch.dispose();
        texture.dispose();
    }
}
```

This program loads [stanley-1.png](/tutorials/libgdx/images/stanley-1.png) from the `assets` directory and draws it to the screen. Also note that we dispose of both the `SpriteBatch` and the `Texture` when we're done.

## Image Stretching

The `SpriteBatch` class contains several versions of the `draw()` function that take a `Texture` and other parameters that allow you to draw only part of the texture, or to change the size of the image drawn to the screen. For example, our above example just draws the texture at `0,0` at its default size:

```java
batch.draw(texture, 0, 0);
```

But we could change that line to something like this:

```java
float x = 125;
float y = 50;
int srcX = 100;
int srcY = 30;
int srcWidth = 300;
int srcHeight = 400;
batch.draw(texture, x, y, srcX, srcY, srcWidth, srcHeight);
```

This code now draws a section of the image to the screen.

There are a bunch of other useful functions in the `SpriteBatch` class. Check them out in [the libGDX wiki](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Spritebatch%2C-Textureregions%2C-and-Sprites) and [the libGDX API](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/ci/nightlies/docs/api/com/badlogic/gdx/graphics/g2d/SpriteBatch.html).

# Sprite Batching

We talked about the idea of **batching** in the [graphics tutorial](/tutorials/libgdx/graphics#batching). If you have a bunch of similar shapes, libGDX (more specifically, your graphics card via OpenGL) can use some internal ~~magic~~ logic to draw them faster if you group them together. The same thing is true of images.

For example, consider this program:

```java
package io.happycoding.helloworld;

import com.badlogic.gdx.ApplicationAdapter;
import com.badlogic.gdx.Gdx;
import com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.GL20;
import com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.Texture;
import com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g2d.SpriteBatch;
import com.badlogic.gdx.math.MathUtils;

public class HelloWorldGame extends ApplicationAdapter {

    SpriteBatch batch;
    Texture texture;

    public void create () {
        batch = new SpriteBatch();
        texture = new Texture(Gdx.files.internal("stanley-1.png"));
    }

    public void render () {
        Gdx.gl.glClearColor(.125f, .125f, .125f, 1);
        Gdx.gl.glClear(GL20.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

        for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
            batch.begin();
            batch.draw(texture, MathUtils.random(Gdx.graphics.getWidth()), MathUtils.random(Gdx.graphics.getHeight()), 50, 50, 0, 1, 1, 0);
            batch.end();
        }

        System.out.println(Gdx.graphics.getFramesPerSecond());
    }

    @Override
    public void dispose() {
        batch.dispose();
        texture.dispose();
    }
}
```

This program draws 10000 copies of the same image to the screen. When I run this program on my computer, I get about 20 frames per second.

This code does not take advantage of batching: it calls `begin()` and `end()` for every individual image. Compare that to this code:

```java
package io.happycoding.helloworld;

import com.badlogic.gdx.ApplicationAdapter;
import com.badlogic.gdx.Gdx;
import com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.GL20;
import com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.Texture;
import com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g2d.SpriteBatch;
import com.badlogic.gdx.math.MathUtils;

public class HelloWorldGame extends ApplicationAdapter {

    SpriteBatch batch;
    Texture texture;

    public void create () {
        batch = new SpriteBatch();
        texture = new Texture(Gdx.files.internal("stanley-1.png"));
    }

    public void render () {
        Gdx.gl.glClearColor(.125f, .125f, .125f, 1);
        Gdx.gl.glClear(GL20.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

        batch.begin();
        for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
            batch.draw(texture, MathUtils.random(Gdx.graphics.getWidth()), MathUtils.random(Gdx.graphics.getHeight()), 50, 50, 0, 1, 1, 0);
        }
        batch.end();

        System.out.println(Gdx.graphics.getFramesPerSecond());
    }

    @Override
    public void dispose() {
        batch.dispose();
        texture.dispose();
    }
}
```

Now our code takes advantage of batching by drawing all of our images between the `batch.begin()` and `batch.end()` calls. When I run this program on my computer, I get about 60 frames per second.

There are other ways to optimize this program, such as resizing the image once instead of every time we draw it. But the point is that you can batch draws of the same image to speed your drawing code up. This is useful for stuff like tiling images for a background or as blocks in your game.
