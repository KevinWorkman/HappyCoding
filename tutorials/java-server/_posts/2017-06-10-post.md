{% include toc.md %}

So far, you've learned that a **client** (like a web browser) works by sending a **request** to a server. The server **responds** to that request, and the client then renders that response to the user.

# GET Requests

You've seen examples where the user navigates to a URL, the client requests the content at that URL, and the server responds with content- either from a file, or from a servlet or JSP.

This type of request is called a `GET` request, because the client is *getting* content from the server. 

This tutorial shows you how to use `POST` requests so clients can *send* data to the server.

# URLs and Query Parameters

One way to send data to the server is to use query parameters, like this:

```
http://localhost:8080/names.html?name=Ada
```

Navigating to this URL requests the `names.html` file and passes it a `name` parameter with a value of `Ada`. You could then use client-side JavaScript or server-side Java to get that parameter and do something with the value.

You've also seen how to use URLs themselves to communicate data to the server. For example, you could have a URL like this:

```
http://localhost:8080/names/Ada
```

You could then use a servlet mapped to `/names/*` to let clients request any name. And then you could use server-side Java code to parse the URL and get the name.

These approaches have a few potential drawbacks:

- The URLs are saved to the user's history. That might be okay with this example, but probably not so great if you're entering passwords or credit card info. That would let somebody else get your passwords by looking at your history!
- Links to the URLs have to be created ahead of time. For example, how would you let the user enter a name other than `Ada`? You'd either have to list every name as a link, or they'd have to enter the URL themselves.
- URLs can only contain 2,083 characters. That might seem like a lot, but what if you're sending something like a blog post or uploading a file?

To work around these limitations, you can use a different kind of request: `POST` requests!

# POST Requests

`GET` requests are clients asking for content from a server, and `POST` requests are clients sending data to a server.

One common way to send a `POST` request is to use a `<form>` tag in HTML content. Here's an example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Name Form</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>What's your name?</h1>

    <form action="/post-name/hello" method="POST">
      <input type="text" name="name" value="Ada">
      <br><br>
      <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>

  </body>
</html>
```

This HTML uses a `<form>` tag, which contains a couple attributes:

- `action` specifies which URL to send the data to.
- `method` specifies that the data should use a `POST` request. Try changing this to `method="GET"` to see the query parameter approach mentioned above!

Inside the `<form>` tag, the HTML contains one `<input>` tag of type `text`, which shows a text box. The `name` attribute specifies the name of the parameter to be sent, and the `value` attribute specifies the default value to display. Then another `<input>` tag of type `submit` shows a submit button.

![simple name form](/tutorials/java-server/images/post-1.png)

Now that you have a form that submits a `POST` request, you need to write server code that handles that request. You've already seen how to handle `GET` requests in a servlet class by writing a `doGet()` function. Handling `POST` requests is very similar; the only difference is you need to write a `doPost()` function.

```java
package io.happycoding.servlets;

import java.io.IOException;
import jakarta.servlet.annotation.WebServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

@WebServlet("/hello")
public class GreetingServlet extends HttpServlet {

  @Override
  public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
      throws IOException {

    String name = request.getParameter("name");

    response.getWriter().println("<h1>Hello " + name + "!</h1>");
  }
}
```

This servlet specifies a `doPost()` function, which gets the `name` parameter from the request and outputs a greeting in HTML.

![hello Ada](/tutorials/java-server/images/post-2.png)

When you run your server, you can visit the `index.html` page, which renders a form. When you submit that form, your browser sends a `POST` request containing the name you entered to your servlet class, which outputs the name in HTML.

You can see this example project [here](https://github.com/KevinWorkman/HappyCoding/tree/gh-pages/examples/java-server/java-server-example-projects/post-name), and you can download it as a `.zip` file [here](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/KevinWorkman/HappyCoding/tree/gh-pages/examples/java-server/java-server-example-projects/post-name).

Eventually you'll learn to do more complicated things with the data, like storing it in a database and retrieving it later, but for now focus on how the data gets from the client to the server.

# Mixing GET and POST Requests

Remember that servlet classes can also contain a `doGet()` function to handle `GET` requests. You can use this to create a servlet that handles both `GET` and `POST` requests for the same URL.

For example, let's build on the previous example so that the servlet contains two functions:

- `doGet()`outputs some HTML based on the values stored in an `ArrayList`.
- `doPost()` takes the name from the request and adds it to the `ArrayList`.

```java
package io.happycoding.servlets;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import jakarta.servlet.annotation.WebServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

@WebServlet("/names")
public class NamesServlet extends HttpServlet {

  List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();

  @Override
  public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
      throws IOException {

    response.getWriter().println("<h1>Names</h1>");

    response.getWriter().println("<ul>");
    for (String name : names) {
      response.getWriter().println("<li>" + name + "</li>");
    }

    response.getWriter().println("</ul>");
    response.getWriter().println(
        "Click <a href=\"/post-name-list/index.html\">here</a> to enter another name.");
  }

  @Override
  public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
      throws IOException {

    String name = request.getParameter("name");

    names.add(name);

    response.getWriter().println("<h1>Hello " + name + "!</h1>");
    response.getWriter().println(
        "Click <a href=\"/post-name-list/names\">here</a> to see everybody's name.");
  }
}
```

To use this servlet, the HTML file stays pretty much the same as before, except the form's `action` attribute uses the new servlet's URL, and the page provides a link to send a `GET` request to the servlet:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Name Form</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>What's your name?</h1>

    <form action="/post-name-list/names" method="POST">
      <input type="text" name="name" value="Ada">
      <br><br>
      <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>

    <hr>

    <p>Click <a href="/post-name/names">here</a> to see everybody's name.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

![name form](/tutorials/java-server/images/post-5.png)

When the user submits the form, the browser sends a `POST` request to the server, which adds the name to the `ArrayList` and then outputs some HTML:

![hello Ada](/tutorials/java-server/images/post-3.png)

When the user navigates to the `/post-name-list/names` URL, the servlet's `doGet()` post iterates over the `ArrayList` and outputs all of the names that have been entered:

![name list](/tutorials/java-server/images/post-4.png)

You can see this example project [here](https://github.com/KevinWorkman/HappyCoding/tree/gh-pages/examples/java-server/java-server-example-projects/post-name-list), and you can download it as a `.zip` file [here](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/KevinWorkman/HappyCoding/tree/gh-pages/examples/java-server/java-server-example-projects/post-name-list).

This example is a little contrived, but it contains a few important concepts: maintaining data on a server, accessing that data through `GET` requests, and modifying that data through `POST` requests. These concepts will continue to be important in the rest of the server tutorials.

# Redirecting After Post

The above example works, but it's a little annoying because the `POST` request is rendered as a separate page, and the user has to click a link to get to the list page.

To fix this, you could copy the code from the `doGet()` function into the `doPost()` function, that way the `POST` request would render the same thing as the `GET` request. Better yet, you could move the logic to a separate function that both the `doGet()` and `doPost()` functions call.

However, that approach has a downside: if the user refreshes, they'll see a message like this:

![form resubmit error](/tutorials/java-server/images/post-6.png)

Because the page is a result of a `POST` request, the client has to send the data again. This results in the same name being posted multiple times, which probably isn't what you want.

Instead, you can redirect the user to send a `GET` request after the `POST` request completes.

```java
public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
    throws IOException {

  String name = request.getParameter("name");

  names.add(name);

  response.sendRedirect("/post-name-list/names");
}
```

The `"/post-name-list/names"` parameter tells the client to send a `GET` request to that URL. Now the web app works like this:

- The user visits `index.html` in their browser, which sends a `GET` request to the server.
- The server responds with the content of that file.
- When a user submits the form, the client sends a `POST` request to the server.
- The `POST` request triggers the `doPost()` function in the servlet, which saves the name and tells the client to redirect back to the `/post-name-list/names` URL.
- The client then sends another `GET` request to the that URL.
- The `GET` request triggers the `doGet()` function in the servlet, which renders all of the names.
- The user can go back to `index.html` to enter another name.

Note that this code redirects to the servlet's URL because we want to trigger the same servlet, but you can redirect to any URL.

# JSP

The above examples use the `response.getWriter().println()` function to output HTML content directly from a servlet. I did this to keep the code short, but in real life this approach is a pain in the neck. Remember from the [JSP](/tutorials/java-server/jsp) tutorial that you can use JSP files to render your content instead. That's still true!

For example, this JSP file renders the list of names:

```jsp
<%@ page import="java.util.List" %>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Name List</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Name List</h1>

    <ul>
      <% List<String> names = (List<String>) request.getAttribute("names"); %>
      <% for (String name : names) { %>
        <li><%= name %></li>
      <% } %>
    </ul>

    <p>Click <a href="/post-name-list-jsp/index.html">here</a> to enter another name.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

This JSP file iterates over the names to show each one in a `<li>` tag.

Now the servlet's `doGet()` function looks like this:

```java
public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
    throws IOException, ServletException {

  request.setAttribute("names", names);
  request.getRequestDispatcher("/WEB-INF/name-list.jsp").forward(request,response);
}
```

The `doPost()` function still adds a name to the `ArrayList` and then redirects to a `GET` request. And now the `doGet()` function adds that list to the request and forwards to the JSP file, which renders the names.

You can see this example project [here](https://github.com/KevinWorkman/HappyCoding/tree/gh-pages/examples/java-server/java-server-example-projects/post-name-list-jsp), and you can download it as a `.zip` file [here](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/KevinWorkman/HappyCoding/tree/gh-pages/examples/java-server/java-server-example-projects/post-name-list-jsp).

# Fetch

You can see this example project [here](https://github.com/KevinWorkman/HappyCoding/tree/gh-pages/examples/java-server/java-server-example-projects/post-name-list-fetch), and you can download it as a `.zip` file [here](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/KevinWorkman/HappyCoding/tree/gh-pages/examples/java-server/java-server-example-projects/post-name-list-fetch).

## Getting with Fetch

Right now, the list of names is its own page. That might be fine, but what if you wanted to show the names on your homepage, or on the same page as the form?

You could use servlets and JSP to show the list of names on other pages, but I want to introduce another common pattern: using JavaScript's `fetch()` function to get the content from your server and insert it into the page.

Remember from [the fetch tutorial](/tutorials/javascript/fetch) that `fetch()` lets you write JavaScript code that requests content from a URL without navigating to a new page. You can use this to request content from a servlet without needing to refresh the page.

First, modify the servlet's `doGet()` function to respond with HTML. Note that this HTML is a subset of the whole page, and only contains the list of names. Then modify the servlet's `doPost()` function to redirect to the `index.html` page, which contains the form.

```java
package io.happycoding.servlets;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import jakarta.servlet.annotation.WebServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

@WebServlet("/names")
public class NamesServlet extends HttpServlet {

  List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();

  @Override
  public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
      throws IOException {

    response.getWriter().println("<ul>");
    for (String name : names) {
      response.getWriter().println("<li>" + name + "</li>");
    }
    response.getWriter().println("</ul>");
  }

  @Override
  public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
      throws IOException {

    String name = request.getParameter("name");

    names.add(name);

    response.sendRedirect("/post-name-list-fetch/index.html");
  }
}
```

Next, modify the `index.html` file so it uses the `fetch()` function to get this content from the servlet and adds it to the page:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Names</title>
    <script>
      async function fetchNames() {
        const response = await fetch('/post-name-list-fetch/names');
        const nameListHtml = await response.text();
        document.getElementById('name-list').innerHTML = nameListHtml;
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body onload="fetchNames();">
    <h1>What's your name?</h1>

    <form action="/post-name-list-fetch/names" method="POST">
      <input type="text" name="name" value="Ada">
      <br><br>
      <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>

    <hr>

    <h1>Name List</h1>
    <div id="name-list">Loading...</div>
  </body>
</html>
```

When the user loads the `index.html` page, the JavaScript calls the `fetch()` function to get the HTML content from the servlet's `doGet()` function, which it adds to the `name-list` `<div>` element. The user can also submit the form, which triggers the servlet's `doPost()` function. The `doPost()` function adds the name to the `ArrayList` on the server and then redirects back to the `index.html` page, which starts the process over by calling the `fetch()` function.

![form and fetched results](/tutorials/java-server/images/post-11.png)

## Posting with Fetch

You can also use the `fetch()` function to send a `POST` request. This approach has the benefit of not needing to refresh the page whenever the user submits the form.

**Note:** Don't feel like you *have* to take this approach. I'm including it because it's useful, but if HTML forms serve your purpose, you can keep using that approach!

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Names</title>
    <script>
      async function fetchNames() {
        const response = await fetch('/post-name-list-fetch/names');
        const nameListHtml = await response.text();
        document.getElementById('name-list').innerHTML = nameListHtml;
      }

      async function postName() {
        const params = new URLSearchParams();
        params.append('name', document.getElementById('name').value);

        const fetchSettings = {method: 'POST', body: params};
        const response =
            await fetch('/post-name-list-fetch/names', fetchSettings);

        fetchNames();
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body onload="fetchNames();">
    <h1>What's your name?</h1>

    <input type="text" id="name" value="Ada">
    <br><br>
    <button onclick="postName();">Submit</button>

    <hr>

    <h1>Name List</h1>
    <div id="name-list">Loading...</div>
  </body>
</html>
```

This HTML contains a `<button>` element with an `onclick` attribute that calls the `postName()` function. The `postName()` function sends a `POST` request using the `fetch()` function. After the `POST` request completes, the code calls the `fetchNames()` function to refresh the list of names at the bottom of the page.

Notice that the page no longer refreshes when the user submits their name, because the code uses the `fetch()` function instead of an HTML form.

# Other Approaches

Like everything else in programming, there are multiple ways to solve some of the problems introduced above. The `fetch()` function is one solution. HTML forms is another. Neither one is better or worse - it all depends on your context and what you think makes more sense.

You could also do something more advanced like using [long polling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology#Long_polling) (pretty much the same as above, except the server waits until a new name is sent to return the content) or [WebSockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) (instead of asking the server for the list of names, the server would send the names to the client whenever there's an update).

The point of this tutorial was to introduce the idea of `POST` requests, so I intentionally left some of these other approaches out. But don't be afraid to do more research and improve upon the ideas that were introduced here!

# Homework

- Expand the web app above. Make it prettier using CSS, or count how many people have each name.
- Create a to-do list web app. Let users add and remove tasks from their list.
- Create a text editor web app. Let users submit a block of text and then see that text at a URL that you assign.
