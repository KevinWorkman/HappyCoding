So far, you've learned how to run a Jetty or Tomcat server, and you know how to set up a static web app. This tutorial introduces **servlets** which lets you write Java code that runs on your server to fulfill requests.

# Servlet Classes

A servlet is a Java class that runs certain functions when a user requests a URL from a server. These functions contain code that reacts to a user's actions, and can do things like save data to a database, execute logic, and return information needed to render a page.

To build a servlet, create a class that extends the `HttpServlet` class, and then define a request handler function. You'll learn about different types of request handlers later, but to get started, define a `doGet()` function:

```java
package io.happycoding;

import java.io.IOException;
import jakarta.servlet.annotation.WebServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

@WebServlet("/hello")
public class HelloWorldServlet extends HttpServlet {

  @Override
  public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
      throws IOException {
    response.setContentType("text/html;");
    response.getWriter().println("<h1>Hello world!</h1>");
  }
}
```

This code defines a `HelloWorldServlet` class, which extends the `HttpServlet` class. It overrides the `doGet()` function, which takes a `HttpServletRequest` and a `HttpServletResponse` as parameters. Inside the `doGet()` function, the code gets a `PrintWriter` from the response and outputs some HTML content to it.

# Compiling Servlet Classes

Just like any other Java file, you have to compile your servlet into a `.class` file. The only trick is that we need to make sure the Java servlet API is on our classpath.

Read [Anatomy of a Web App](/tutorials/java-server/web-app) for a few approaches you can use to compile your server classes. To help you get started, here are some example projects:

- You can see an [hello world](https://github.com/KevinWorkman/HappyCoding/tree/gh-pages/examples/java-server/java-server-example-projects/hello-world-command-line) example project that uses the command line to package a web app, and you can download it as a `.zip` file from the [DownGit link](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/KevinWorkman/HappyCoding/tree/gh-pages/examples/java-server/java-server-example-projects/hello-world-command-line).
- You can see an [hello world maven](https://github.com/KevinWorkman/HappyCoding/tree/gh-pages/examples/java-server/java-server-example-projects/hello-world-maven) example project that uses Maven to package a web app, and you can download it as a `.zip` file from the [DownGit link](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/KevinWorkman/HappyCoding/tree/gh-pages/examples/java-server/java-server-example-projects/hello-world-maven).

# Annotations

The `HelloWorldServlet` class doesn't have a `main()` function, so how do you run it? The answer is you don't! Instead, you need to tell your server to run the code when a user requests a certain URL from it. To do that, the code uses the `@WebServlet` annotation.

```java
...
@WebServlet("/hello")
public class HelloWorldServlet extends HttpServlet {
...
```

This annotation tells your server that this servlet class will handle any requests sent to the `/hello` URL.

So far, you've only seen `GET` requests which are triggered when you navigate to a URL in a web browser. When your server receives a `GET` request for the `/hello` URL, it automatically calls the `doGet()` function of the servlet with the matching annotation. 

# Query Parameters

So far, you've been mapping a single URL to a servlet. But you can make more advanced requests.

For example, you can read **query parameters** in your servlet and use them in your Java code. You do this using the `request.getParameter()` function, like this:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import jakarta.servlet.annotation.WebServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

@WebServlet("/hello")
public class HelloWorldServlet extends HttpServlet {

	@Override
	public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {

		String name = request.getParameter("name");
		
		PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
		out.println("<h1>Hello " + name + "</h1>");
		out.println("<p>Nice to meet you!</p>");
	}
}
```

This servlet uses the `request.getParameter()` function to get the `name` parameter, and it uses that to output a greeting in HTML. Add this code to your servlet and then visit `/hello?name=Kevin` to see this:

![hello world servlet](/tutorials/java-server/images/servlets-2.png)

Try changing the query parameter to see different names!

# URL Paths

Remember that the `@WebServlet` annotation on a servlet class tells your server which URL to map the servlet to. For example, this annotation maps the `index.html` URL to a servlet:

```xml
@WebServlet("/index.html")
```

In addition to single URLs, you can also use the asterisk `*` wildcard symbol to map multiple URLs to the same servlet. Here's an example:

```xml
@WebServlet("/hello/*")
```

This annotation maps any URL that starts with `/hello/` to the servlet. So any of these URLs would trigger the servlet's response functions:

- `/HelloWorldWebApp/hello/`
- `/hello/Ada`
- `/hello/Grace/Hopper`

This lets you generate different content depending on the URL. In your servlet, you can use the `request.getRequestURI()` function, which gives you the URL after the domain (the `http://localhost:8080` or `example.com` part).

So if you visit `/hello/Kevin`, you can get the `/hello/Kevin` part of the URL using the `request.getRequestURI()` function. Then to get the `Kevin` part, you can use the `substring()` function. Putting it all together, it looks like this:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import jakarta.servlet.annotation.WebServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

@WebServlet("/hello/*")
public class HelloWorldServlet extends HttpServlet {

	@Override
	public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {

		String requestUrl = request.getRequestURI();
		String name = requestUrl.substring("/hello/".length());

		PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
		out.println("<h1>Hello " + name + "</h1>");
		out.println("<p>Nice to meet you!</p>");
	}
}
```

Then visit `/hello/Kevin` and you should see this:

![hello world servlet](/tutorials/java-server/images/servlets-3.png)

Now try going to different URLs to change the greeting. Imagine how hard this would be with with static HTML files!

# Multiple Servlets

So far, all of the example web apps have contained a single servlet. But you aren't limited to just using one servlet at a time. Your web app can contain multiple servlets!

Add another servlet to your web app by creating another class that extends the `HttpServlet` class:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.util.Date;
import jakarta.servlet.annotation.WebServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

@WebServlet("/date.html")
public class DateServlet extends HttpServlet {

	@Override
	public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {

		Date now = new Date();

		PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
		out.println("<p>Current time: " + now.toString() + "</p>");
	}
}
```

Compile this code the same way you compiled your first servlet class, and then open a browser to `/date.html` and you should see this:

![hello world servlet](/tutorials/java-server/images/servlets-4.png)

You can also still visit URLs like `/hello/Felicia` to trigger your first servlet.

Most web apps will consist of several servlets, which is a handy way to split up your logic.

# Mixing Static and Dynamic Content

In the setup tutorials, you learned how to serve static files from your server. This tutorial showed you how to create dynamic content using a servlet class. But it's not an either-or thing: you can serve both static files and dynamic content from the same server!

For example, add this static `index.html` page to your web app:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>My Web App</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Welcome to my web app!</h1>
		<p>Here are some names in the greeting servlet:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="/hello/Ada">Ada<a></li>
			<li><a href="/hello/Grace">Grace<a></li>
			<li><a href="/hello/Hal">Hal<a></li>		
		</ul>
		<p><a href="/date.html">Here</a> is the current time servlet.</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

Save this to a file named `index.html` using the directory structure introduced in the [Anatomy of a Web App](/tutorials/java-server/web-app) tutorial. Then open a browser to `/index.html` and you should see this:

![static page in dynamic web app](/tutorials/java-server/images/servlets-5.png)

This new `index.html` file is a static page that links to the servlet URLs. This approach of mixing static and dynamic content is useful when you have some sites that should always be the same (like a homepage or an about page), but other pages that should change (like user profiles or data fetched from a database). It's also useful for storing stuff like CSS files and images, which you can use in your dynamic HTML.

# Outputting HTML

In the examples above, the servlets didn't output a full HTML page. I did this mostly to keep them shorter, but you can output a full HTML page from your servlet. That might look like this:

```java
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Date;
import jakarta.servlet.annotation.WebServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

@WebServlet("/date.html")
public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {

	@Override
	public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {
		PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
		out.println("<!DOCTYPE html>");
		out.println("<html>");
		out.println("<head>");
		out.println("<title>My Web App</title>");
		out.println("</head>");
		out.println("<body>");
		out.println("<h1>My Web App</h1>");
		out.println("<p>The current time is: " + new Date().toString() + "</p>");
		out.println("</body>");
		out.println("</html>");
	}
}
```

This code is meant as an example of outputting a full HTML page to the client. It's pretty unwieldy though, so you'll learn better ways to do that in the next tutorial.
