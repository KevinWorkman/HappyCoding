So far, we've learned how to run a Jetty server and how to set up a static web app. This tutorial walks through servlets and dynamic web apps.

## Servlet Classes

A servlet is a Java class that runs certain functions when a user requests a URL from a server. These functions contain code that reacts to a user's actions, such as saving data to a database, executing logic, and returning information needed to render a page.

To build a servlet, we create a class that extends the `HttpServlet` class, and we define a request handler function. We'll talk more about those later, but for now let's just define a `doGet()` function.

```java
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

public class HelloWorldServlet extends HttpServlet {

	@Override
	public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {
		PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
		out.println("<h1>Hello world!</h1>");
		out.println("<p>This is our first servlet.</p>");
	}
}
```

This is pretty much just like any other Java class you've seen. It defines a `HelloWorldServlet` class, which extends the `HttpServlet` class. It overrides the `doGet()` function, which takes a `HttpServletRequest` and a `HttpServletResponse` as parameters. Inside the `doGet()` function, we get a `PrintWriter` from the response and we output some HTML content to it.

Save this to a file named `HelloWorldServlet.java`. You can put this file anywhere you want.

Just like any other Java file, we have to compile this into a `.class` file. The only trick is that we need to make sure the Java servlet API is on our classpath.

The Java servlet API is a library that comes with Jetty (or with any other server). It's located in the `lib` folder inside our Jetty directory. For example, mine is located at `C:/Users/kevin/Desktop/jetty/lib/servlet-api-3.1.jar`. So to compile my `HelloWorldServlet` class, I would add that `.jar` file to my classpath using the `-cp` argument, like this:

```
javac -cp C:/Users/kevin/Desktop/jetty/lib/servlet-api-3.1.jar HelloWorldServlet.java
```

This should create a `HelloWorldServlet.class` file.

## The `web.xml` File

Even though `HelloWorldServlet` is a normal Java class, it doesn't have a `main()` function, so how do we run it? The answer is we don't! Instead, we need to tell our server to run it for us when a user requests a certain URL from it. To do that, save this XML into a file named `web.xml`:

```xml
<web-app>

	<servlet>
		<servlet-name>MyHelloWorldServlet</servlet-name>
		<servlet-class>HelloWorldServlet</servlet-class>
	</servlet>

	<servlet-mapping>
		<servlet-name>MyHelloWorldServlet</servlet-name>
		<url-pattern>/index.html</url-pattern>
	</servlet-mapping>

</web-app>
```

This might look confusing at first, but let's take it one step at a time:

- The outermost `<web-app>` tag means that we're defining properties to set up a web app on our server.
- The `<servlet>` tag tells our server about the servlet class we just wrote.
  - The `<servlet-name>` tag gives our servlet a name. This can be anything you want. It's only used inside this `web.xml` file and isn't visible to users!
  - The `<servlet-class>` tag specifies which class should be used for this servlet. Note: if your class is in a package, include that in the tag!
- The `<servlet-mapping>` tag tells our server which URLs should trigger which servlet classes.
  - The `<servlet-name>` tag references the name we defined in the `<servlet>` tag. Make sure it matches.
  - The `<url-pattern>` tag tells the server which URL should trigger our servlet. Note that this is relative to our web app (more on that in a second).
  
So, this `web.xml` file tells our server that when a user requests the `index.html` URL, it should trigger our `HelloWorldServlet` class.

## Dynamic Web App Directory Structure

Now that we have our `HelloWorldServlet.class` and `web.xml` files, we can bundle them up into a web app. To do that, we need to put together a specific set of directories inside Jetty's `webapp` folder.

First, we need to create a directory that contains our webapp: let's name it `HelloWorldWebApp`. Inside that directory, create another directory named `WEB-INF`. Inside that directory, put the `web.xml` file, and one more directory named `classes`. Inside the `classes` directory, put the `HelloWorldServlet.class` file. Copy the whole `HelloWorldWebApp` directory inside Jetty's `webapps` folder.

In other words, our directory structure should look like this:

- `jetty/`
  - `start.jar`
  - `(bunch of other files)`
  - `webapps/`
    - `HelloWorldWebApp/`
      - `WEB-INF/`
        - `web.xml`
        - `classes/`
          - `HelloWorldServlet.class`

Now our web app is setup, so run the Jetty server and open a web browser to [http://localhost:8080/HelloWorldWebApp/index.html](http://localhost:8080/HelloWorldWebApp/index.html), and you should see this:

![hello world servlet](/tutorials/java-server/images/servlets-1.png)

Let's take a closer look at the URL and examine what our server does with each part:

- `http://localhost:8080/` is the location of our Jetty server.
- `HelloWorldWebApp/` is the name of our web app. Remember that we can eliminate this part by naming our webapp `root`.
- `index.html` is the name of the "file" that we request from our web app. But note that there isn't an actual `index.html` file anywhere! Instead, our `web.xml` file knows that any requests for `index.html` should be sent to our `HelloWorldServlet` class.

Back in our `HelloWorldServlet` class, the server calls the `doGet()` function (because the request is asking to **get** the `index.html` file). The `out.println()` statements in our `doGet()` function allow us to build HTML that is then sent back to the client. Try viewing the source of the `index.html` page. To the client, it's the exact same thing as a regular `index.html` file, but the server generated it using Java code instead of reading it from a file!

## WEB-INF

An important thing to note about the `WEB-INF` directory is that everything inside it is invisible to the user. In other words, users can't get to it by going to a URL like [http://localhost:8080/HelloWorldWebApp/WEB-INF/web.xml](http://localhost:8080/HelloWorldWebApp/WEB-INF/web.xml). Even if you put `.html` files in here, the user can't get to them!

This is a good thing. You usually don't want the user to know exactly what your server is doing. You just want them to see the final output.

## Query Parameters

So far, we've been mapping a single URL to a servlet. But we can make more advanced requests.

For example, we can read query parameters in our servlet and use them in our Java code. We do this using the `request.getParameter()` function, like this:

```java
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

public class HelloWorldServlet extends HttpServlet {

	@Override
	public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {

		String name = request.getParameter("name");
		
		PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
		out.println("<h1>Hello " + name + "</h1>");
		out.println("<p>Nice to meet you!</p>");
	}
}
```

This servlet uses the `request.getParameter()` function to get the `name` parameter, and it uses that to output a greeting in HTML. Make this change to your servlet and then visit [http://localhost:8080/HelloWorldWebApp/index.html?name=Kevin](http://localhost:8080/HelloWorldWebApp/index.html?name=Kevin) to see this:

![hello world servlet](/tutorials/java-server/images/servlets-2.png)

Try changing the query parameter to see different names!

## URL Paths

Remember that the `<url-patten>` tag inside `web.xml` file defines a URL to map to a servlet class. For example, this XML maps the `index.html` URL to our servlet:

```xml
	<servlet-mapping>
		<servlet-name>MyHelloWorldServlet</servlet-name>
		<url-pattern>/index.html</url-pattern>
	</servlet-mapping>
```

In addition to single URLs, we can also use the asterisk `*` wildcard symbol to map multiple URLs to the same servlet. Here's an example:

```xml
<web-app>

	<servlet>
		<servlet-name>MyHelloWorldServlet</servlet-name>
		<servlet-class>HelloWorldServlet</servlet-class>
	</servlet>

	<servlet-mapping>
		<servlet-name>MyHelloWorldServlet</servlet-name>
		<url-pattern>/hello/*</url-pattern>
	</servlet-mapping>

</web-app>
```

This XML maps any URL that starts with `/hello/` to our servlet. So any of these URLs would trigger our servlet:

- `http://localhost:8080/HelloWorldWebApp/hello/`
- `http://localhost:8080/HelloWorldWebApp/hello/Kevin`
- `http://localhost:8080/HelloWorldWebApp/hello/Kevin/Workman`

This allows us to generate different content depending on the URL. In our servlet, we can use the `request.getRequestURI()` function, which gives us the URL after the domain (the `http://localhost:8080` part).

So if we visit `http://localhost:8080/HelloWorldWebApp/hello/Kevin`, we can get the `/HelloWorldWebApp/hello/Kevin` part using the `request.getRequestURI()` function. Then to get the `Kevin` part, we can use the `substring()` function. Putting it all together, it looks like this:

```java
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

public class HelloWorldServlet extends HttpServlet {

	@Override
	public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {

		String requestUrl = request.getRequestURI();
		String name = requestUrl.substring("/HelloWorldWebApp/hello/".length());

		PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
		out.println("<h1>Hello " + name + "</h1>");
		out.println("<p>Nice to meet you!</p>");
	}
}
```

Compile this class and move it into the `classes` directory inside our web app. Then visit [http://localhost:8080/HelloWorldWebApp/hello/Kevin](http://localhost:8080/HelloWorldWebApp/hello/Kevin) and you should see this:

![hello world servlet](/tutorials/java-server/images/servlets-3.png)

Now try going to different URLs to change the greeting. Imagine doing this with static files!

## Multiple Servlets

So far, all of our web apps have contained a single servlet. But we aren't limited to just using one servlet at a time. Our web app can contain multiple servlets!

Let's add another servlet to our web app by creating another class that extends the `HttpServlet` class:

```java
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Date;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

public class DateServlet extends HttpServlet {

	@Override
	public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {

		Date now = new Date();

		PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
		out.println("<p>Current time: " + now.toString() + "</p>");
	}
}
```

Then we compile that using this command:

```
javac -cp C:/Users/kevin/Desktop/jetty/lib/servlet-api-3.1.jar HelloWorldServlet.java
```

We copy that into the `classes` folder of our web app directory, and we add it to our `web.xml` file:

```xml
<web-app>

	<servlet>
		<servlet-name>MyHelloWorldServlet</servlet-name>
		<servlet-class>HelloWorldServlet</servlet-class>
	</servlet>

	<servlet>
		<servlet-name>MyDateServlet</servlet-name>
		<servlet-class>DateServlet</servlet-class>
	</servlet>
	
	<servlet-mapping>
		<servlet-name>MyHelloWorldServlet</servlet-name>
		<url-pattern>/hello/*</url-pattern>
	</servlet-mapping>
	
	<servlet-mapping>
		<servlet-name>MyDateServlet</servlet-name>
		<url-pattern>/date.html</url-pattern>
	</servlet-mapping>

</web-app>
```

Now our `web.xml` file contains the definition and URL mapping for two `<servlet>` tags: one for our `HelloWorldServlet`, and another one for the new `DateServlet`.

Now open a browser to [http://localhost:8080/HelloWorldWebApp/date.html](http://localhost:8080/HelloWorldWebApp/date.html), and you should see this:

![hello world servlet](/tutorials/java-server/images/servlets-4.png)

You can also still visit URLs like [http://localhost:8080/HelloWorldWebApp/hello/Felicia](http://localhost:8080/HelloWorldWebApp/hello/Felicia) to activate the other servlet.

Splitting your web app into multiple servlets isn't an exact science, but most web apps will consist of multiple servlets.

## Mixing Static and Dynamic Content

In the [Jetty setup tutorial](/tutorials/java-server/jetty-setup), we learned how to serve static files from our server. And this tutorial showed you how to create dynamic files using a servlet class. But it's not an either-or thing: you can serve both static files and dynamic pages from the same server!

For example, let's add this static `index.html` page to our web app:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>My Web App</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Welcome to my web app!</h1>
		<p>Here are some names in the greeting servlet:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://localhost:8080/HelloWorldWebApp/hello/Ada">Ada<a></li>
			<li><a href="http://localhost:8080/HelloWorldWebApp/hello/Grace">Grace<a></li>
			<li><a href="http://localhost:8080/HelloWorldWebApp/hello/Hal">Hal<a></li>		
		</ul>
		<p><a href="http://localhost:8080/HelloWorldWebApp/date.html">Here</a> is the current time servlet.</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

Save this to a file named `index.html` inside the `HelloWorldWebApp` directory (but not inside the `WEB-INF` folder!), so your whole directory structure looks like this:

- `jetty/`
  - `start.jar`
  - `(bunch of other files)`
  - `webapps/`
    - `HelloWorldWebApp/`
      - `index.html` **<- this is the new file!**
      - `WEB-INF/`
        - `web.xml`
        - `classes/`
          - `HelloWorldServlet.class`
          - `DateServlet.class`
          
Now open a browser to [http://localhost:8080/HelloWorldWebApp/index.html](http://localhost:8080/HelloWorldWebApp/index.html), and you should see this:

![static page in dynamic web app](/tutorials/java-server/images/servlets-5.png)

This new `index.html` file is a static page that links to our dynamic servlets. This approach of mixing static and dynamic content is useful when you have some sites that should always be the same (like a homepage or an about page), but other pages that should change (like user profiles or data fetched from a database). It's also useful for storing stuff like CSS files and images, which you can use in your HTML.

## Outputting HTML

Note that in the examples above, our servlets didn't output a full HTML page. I did this mostly to keep them shorter, but note you would still want to output a full HTML page. That might look like this:

```java
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Date;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {

	@Override
	public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {
		PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
		out.println("<!DOCTYPE html>");
		out.println("<html>");
		out.println("<head>");
		out.println("<title>My Web App</title>");
		out.println("</head>");
		out.println("<body>");
		out.println("<h1>My Web App</h1>");
		out.println("<p>The current time is: " + new Date().toString() + "</p>");
		out.println("</body>");
		out.println("</html>");
	}
}
```

This code is just showing you an example of outputting a full HTML page to the client. It's pretty unwieldy though, so we'll learn better ways to do that in the next tutorial.
