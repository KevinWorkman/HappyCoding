Now we know how to add **servlets** to our web apps. A servlet looks like this:

```java
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Date;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {

	@Override
	public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {
		PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
		out.println("<!DOCTYPE html>");
		out.println("<html>");
		out.println("<head>");
		out.println("<title>My Web App</title>");
		out.println("</head>");
		out.println("<body>");
		out.println("<h1>My Web App</h1>");
		out.println("<p>The current time is: " + new Date().toString() + "</p>");
		out.println("</body>");
		out.println("</html>");
	}
}
```

This code uses the `out.println()` function to output HTML one line at a time. In other words, this is HTML inside Java.

There are a few problems with having HTML inside Java:

- It's hard to edit. Even this basic HTML is annoying to work with.
- It's hard to format with proper indentation (which makes it hard to edit).
- It's hard to debug: how do you find a typo in the middle of a bunch of String values?

Basically, it's just annoying to work this way.

This tutorial introduces JSP, or JavaServer Pages, which are more like Java inside HTML.

## JSP Files

Instead of writing a Java program that contains HTML, JSP allows you to write HTML that contains Java code. Here's a JSP file that outputs the same dynamic content (the current date) as the above servlet:

```jsp
<%@ page import="java.util.Date" %>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>My Web App</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>My Web App</h1>
		<p>The current time is: <%= new Date().toString() %></p>
	</body>
</html>
```

Save this to a file named `date.jsp` in your web app's directory. Your file structure should look like this:

- `jetty/`
  - `start.jar`
  - `(bunch of other files)`
  - `webapps/`
    - `MyWebApp/`
      - `date.jsp`

Now open a browser to [http://localhost:8080/MyWebApp/date.jsp](http://localhost:8080/MyWebApp/date.jsp), and you should see this:

![date jsp](/tutorials/java-server/images/jsp-1.png)

When you visit the `.jsp` file, the Jetty server automatically compiles it into a servlet class, which then works just like any other servlet. Note that this requires a Java server! So you can't upload a `.jsp` file to any file host. It has to be a Java server.

But now instead of writing Java code that contains HTML, you can write HTML that contains Java code. This makes it much easier to write a webpage.

There are a few ways to include Java code in a JSP page.

## Scriptlets

A scriptlet is Java code that **does something** and is placed between opening `<%` and closing `%>` scriptlet tags. Here's an example:

```jsp
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Coin Flipper</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Coin Flipper</h1>
		<p>Flipping a coin...</p>
		<% if(Math.random() < .5){ %>
			<p>Heads!</p>
		<% } 
		else{ %>
			<p>Tails!</p>
		<% } %>
		<hr />
		<p>Refresh to flip again.</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

This code uses an `if` statement and the `Math.random()` function to show `Heads!` or `Tails!` randomly.

![coin flipper jsp](/tutorials/java-server/images/jsp-2.png)

Notice a couple things in the above code:

- You can use regular Java code, like `if` statements and `for` loops.
- The Java code's flow determines the HTML output. For example this code only prints out `<p>Heads!</p>` or `<p>Tails!</p>` depending on the result of the `if` statement.
- Scriptlets can contain multiple lines of code.
- You can split the Java code into multiple scriptlets. For example one scriptlet can contain the opening of the `if` statement, and another scriptlet contains the closing bracket.

## Expressions

An expression is Java code that **evaluates to a value** and is placed between opening `<%=` and closing `%>` expression tags. Here's an example:

```jsp
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Unix Time</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Unix Time</h1>
		<p>The current Unix time is: <%= System.currentTimeMillis() %></p>
		<hr />
		<p>Showing number of milliseconds since midnight on January 1, 1970.</p>
		<p>Click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">here</a> for more info.</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

This code uses an expression to insert the value returned from the `System.currentTimeMillis()` function into the HTML of the page.

![unix time JSP](/tutorials/java-server/images/jsp-3.png)

## Mixing Scriptlets and Expressions

You can use both scriptlets (code that does something) and expressions (code that evaluates to a value) in the same JSP file. Here's a very basic example:

```jsp
<% String message = "hello!"; %>
<p>Here's some HTML</p>
<p>Message: <%= message %></p>
```

Notice that we use a scriptlet to create a `message` variable. Then later on in the code, we use an epression to insert the value of that variable into the HTML.

Here's a more complicated example:

```jsp
<% String[] animals = {
	"lions", "tigers", "bears", "lizards", "zebras",
	"kangaroos", "elephants", "cows", "monkeys", "anteaters"
	}; %>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>JSP Zoo</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>JSP Zoo</h1>
		<p>Here are the animals we visited at the zoo:</p>
		<% for(int i = 0; i < animals.length; i++){ %>
			<p><%= i+1 %>: <%= animals[i] %></p>
		<% } %>
	</body>
</html>
```

This code uses a scriptlet to define an array named `animals`. Then it uses another scriptlet to iterate over that array using a `for` loop. Inside the `for` loop, it uses an expression to print the index, and the value in the array at that index. Finally, it uses another scriptlet to close the loop.

![JSP zoo](/tutorials/java-server/images/jsp-4.png)

## Directives

So far, we've learned that scriptlets contain code that does something, and expressions contain code that evaluates to a value. Directives are placed between opening `<%@` and closing `%>` tags, and they contain code that tells the page itself what to do.

Directives can contain things like Java `import` statements, like in the first line of this code:

```jsp
<%@ page import="java.util.Date" %>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>My Web App</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>My Web App</h1>
		<p>The current time is: <%= new Date().toString() %></p>
	</body>
</html>
```

Directives can also be used to include content from other files. For example, we can use this to create a navigation bar in one file, and then include that file in all of our JSP pages.

Save this content to a file named `header.html`:

```html
<div style="border: thin solid black; padding:5px;">
	<a href="home.jsp">Home</a>
	<a href="about.jsp">About</a>
	<a href="pictures.jsp">Pictures</a>
	<a href="help.jsp">Help</a>
</div>
```

Now that we have that file, we can use a directive to include that on our JSP pages:

```jsp
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Header Example</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<%@ include file = "header.html" %>
		<p>Content goes here.</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

The include directive inside the `<body>` tag copies the content from `header.html` into the content of the JSP file, so we see the header in our page:

![JSP header include](/tutorials/java-server/images/jsp-5.png)

This makes it easy to share content between multiple pages. If we had 100 pages that included the header, we would only need to change one file to change the header on every page.

## Errors

Remember that JSP files are compiled into servlets automatically. That means we have to pay attention to the output, so we know when errors happen.

Let's take this example JSP:


```jsp
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Error Example</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<% String messageOne = "hello"; %>
		<p>Message: <%= messageTwo %></p>
	</body>
</html>
```

This code creates a `messageOne` variable, but then tries to read a `messageTwo` variable. The `messageTwo` variable doesn't exist, so this code won't compile.

If we try to visit this page, we'll see an error:

![JSP error](/tutorials/java-server/images/jsp-6.png)

This can seem overwhelming at first, but it's actually telling you exactly what the problem is.

```
An error occurred at line: 8 in the jsp file: /index.jsp
messageTwo cannot be resolved to a variable
5: 	</head>
6: 	<body>
7: 		<% String messageOne = "hello"; %>
8: 		<p>Message: <%= messageTwo %></p>
9: 	</body>
10: </html>
```

This is telling you that the error is on line 8, and that it can't find the `messageTwo` variable.

For better or worse, encountering errors like this is a natural part of programming! If you can't figure out where an error is coming from, try to [isolate the problem](/tutorials/how-to/program) in a smaller example.

## Mixing Servlets and JSP Files

Now we know how to use **servlets**. A servlet looks like this:

```java
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Date;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {

	@Override
	public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {
		PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
		out.println("<!DOCTYPE html>");
		out.println("<html>");
		out.println("<head>");
		out.println("<title>My Web App</title>");
		out.println("</head>");
		out.println("<body>");
		out.println("<h1>My Web App</h1>");
		out.println("<p>The current time is: " + new Date().toString() + "</p>");
		out.println("</body>");
		out.println("</html>");
	}
}
```

And we know how to use **JSP** files. A JSP file looks like this:

```jsp
<%@ page import="java.util.Date" %>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>My Web App</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>My Web App</h1>
		<p>The current time is: <%= new Date().toString() %></p>
	</body>
</html>
```

There are pros and cons to both approaches. Servlets make it easier to use Java code, but it can be very annoying to program HTML in them. On the other hand, JSP files make it easy to mix HTML and Java, but it can be annoying to include complicated logic inside a JSP file.

We can use a mix of both servlets and JSP files to get the best of both worlds: we can use servlets to execute our logic with Java code, and we can use JSP files to render a page using parameters generated from the servlet.

For example, let's redo our above example to use a servlet that generates the current time and passes it as a parameter to a JSP file for rendering.

Here's what our Servlet would look like:

```java
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;
import java.util.Date;
import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

public class DateServlet extends HttpServlet {

	@Override
	public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException, ServletException {

		// 5:12 PM on Saturday, June 3, 2017
		SimpleDateFormat dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat("hh:mm aa 'on' EEEE, MMMM dd, yyyy");
		Date now = new Date();
		String formattedDate = dateFormat.format(now);

		request.setAttribute("date", formattedDate);
		request.getRequestDispatcher("dateView.jsp").forward(request,response);
	}
}
```

This code uses the `SimpleDateFormat` class to format the current time. It then uses the `request.setAttribute()` function to include the formatted date in the request, and then it uses the `request.getRequestDispatcher("path/to/view.jsp").forward(request, response)` function to send the request to a JSP file.

Next, we'd need need a `dateView.jsp` file that handles the request:

```jsp
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Current Time</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Current Time</h1>
		<p>The current time is <%= request.getAttribute("date") %></p>
	</body>
</html>
```

Notice the `<%= request.getAttribute("date") %>` expression, which gets the `date` attribute that the servlet added.

This allows us to keep our JSP code simple, and all of our logic in our servlets.

Tying it together, we'd need a `web.xml` file that mapped a request to the servlet:

```xml
<web-app>

	<servlet>
		<servlet-name>CurrentTimeServlet</servlet-name>
		<servlet-class>DateServlet</servlet-class>
	</servlet>

	<servlet-mapping>
		<servlet-name>CurrentTimeServlet</servlet-name>
		<url-pattern>/current-time</url-pattern>
	</servlet-mapping>

</web-app>
```

This XML creates a `CurrentTimeServlet` from our `DateServlet` class and then maps the `/current-time` URL to that servlet.

At this point, our directory structure should look like this:

- `jetty/`
  - `start.jar`
  - `(bunch of other files)`
  - `webapps/`
    - `MyWebApp/`
      - `dateView.jsp`
      - `WEB-INF/`
        - `web.xml`
        - `classes/`
          - `DateServlet.class`
      

And now if we navigate to [http://localhost:8080/MyWebApp/current-time](http://localhost:8080/MyWebApp/current-time) in our browser, we should see:

![current time webpage](/tutorials/java-server/images/mvc-1.png)

## Expression Language

So far, we've been using a simplified version of `web.xml` just to keep it short. But now that we're getting more complicated, we're ready to use more advanced features. To activate them, let's use a **deployment descriptor** in our `web.xml` file.

```xml
<web-app
	xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee"
	xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
	xsi:schemaLocation="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee
		http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_3_1.xsd"
	version="3.1">

	<servlet>
		<servlet-name>CurrentTimeServlet</servlet-name>
		<servlet-class>DateServlet</servlet-class>
	</servlet>

	<servlet-mapping>
		<servlet-name>CurrentTimeServlet</servlet-name>
		<url-pattern>/current-time</url-pattern>
	</servlet-mapping>

</web-app>
```

The only thing that changes is the addition of attributes in the opening `<web-app>` tag. These tell the server that we want to use the latest features, including **expression language** in our JSP files.

Expression language (or EL) gives us a simplified syntax for doing things like accessing attributes. So now we can use `${date}` instead of `<%= request.getAttribute("date") %>`:

```jsp
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Current Time</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Current Time</h1>
		<p>The current time is ${date}</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

## Hiding JSP Files

Remember that users can't directly access stuff inside the `WEB-INF` directory. But because our `dateView.jsp` file is not inside the `WEB-INF` directory, it's publicly available. That means users can visit [http://localhost:8080/MyWebApp/dateView.jsp](http://localhost:8080/MyWebApp/dateView.jsp) directly, which shows a page like this:

![blank current time webpage](/tutorials/java-server/images/mvc-2.png)

Notice that the current time is blank. Because we're accessing the `dateView.jsp` file directly, the servlet wasn't triggered, so it didn't add the current time to the attributes. We probably want to prevent users from being able to see buggy pages like this, so let's hide our JSP files.

We can do this by moving the `dateView.jsp` file inside the `WEB-INF` directory. Let's put it inside a `jsp` folder, so our directory structure looks like this:

- `jetty/`
  - `start.jar`
  - `(bunch of other files)`
  - `webapps/`
    - `MyWebApp/`
      - `WEB-INF/`
        - `web.xml`
        - `jsp/`
          - `dateView.jsp`
        - `classes/`
          - `DateServlet.class`
          

Now we would just need to change our `DateServlet` code to point to the new location of `dateView.jsp`:

```java
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;
import java.util.Date;
import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

public class DateServlet extends HttpServlet {

	@Override
	public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException, ServletException {

		// 5:12 PM on Saturday, June 3, 2017
		SimpleDateFormat dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat("hh:mm aa 'on' EEEE, MMMM dd, yyyy");
		Date now = new Date();
		String formattedDate = dateFormat.format(now);

		request.setAttribute("date", formattedDate);
		request.getRequestDispatcher("/WEB-INF/jsp/dateView.jsp").forward(request,response);
	}
}
```

Notice how we now forward the request to `/WEB-INF/jsp/dateView.jsp`. Our code is allowed to access the `WEB-INF` directory, but users can't see what's inside it. This allows us to keep things mostly hidden from users.

## MVC

This approach of using servlets to contain our logic and JSP files to contain our rendering code gets us closer to [Model-View-Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller), or MVC.

MVC is the idea of separating your data from your logic from your rendering. It allows you to focus on one thing at a time, and makes debugging and making changes to one piece much easier. You can use this idea in any type of programming, but when developing server code it generally works like this:

- Your model is the data structures that hold your site's data. This can be things like a database or `ArrayList` objects that hold data.
- Your controller is your servlet classes. These read from your model and execute logic.
- Your view is your JSP files. These take parameters from your controller to render a page.

You don't have to worry about getting everything exactly correct, and concepts like MVC are more of a way of thinking about organization than it is a strict set of rules. But keeping your data, your logic, and your rendering separate will definitely make your life easier. And this approach of splitting your servlets and your JSP files will help with that.

## Static Files

We can still use static files with this approach. So we can have an `index.html` file that looks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>My Home Page</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Welcome to my web page!</h1>
		<p>Click <a href="http://localhost:8080/MyWebApp/current-time">here</a> to see the current time.</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

Put this in your `MyWebApp` directory (not inside the `WEB-INF` folder), and then visit [http://localhost:8080/MyWebApp/index.html](http://localhost:8080/MyWebApp/index.html) to see a page like this:

![static home page](/tutorials/java-server/images/mvc-3.png)

Note that this static file links to our dynamic page that shows the current time. You can also go the other way and link from a dynamic page to static files. This allows us to load stuff like images and CSS files in our JSP views. Remember: the end result is just regular HTML, so anything you can do in HTML, you can do with servlets and JSP files.
