This tutorial walks through the process of using [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) to run a server on your computer. Running a local Tomcat server is handy for testing things out without needing to update (or pay for) a live server.

Tomcat is one of the most popular Java servers out there, and it provides a standard environment that most Java server code will work with. If your code works with Tomcat, chances are it'll work with most environments.

# Download Tomcat

Tomcat is bundled as an `apache-tomcat` directory inside a `.zip` file, which you can download from [here](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-10.cgi).

Download that file, and then unzip the directory anywhere. I put mine on my desktop. You can always move it later.

# Run Tomcat

Now that you've downloaded Tomcat, you can run a Tomcat server!

Find the `startup.bat` file in the `bin` directory and run it, either through the command line or by double-clicking it.

Then navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and you should see something like this:

That means you've successfully run a Tomcat server!

# Hello World Web App

You can think of a *web app* as a website and everything in it, including its server code. Now that you have a Tomcat server running, you can add web apps to it!

In your Tomcat folder, notice the `webapps` directory. This is where your web apps will go.

To add a web app to your server, create a folder inside the `webapps` directory, and then add your files inside your folder.

For example, create a `HelloWorld` folder inside your `webapps` directory. Inside the `HelloWorld` directory, save this HTML to a file named `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Tomcat Hello World</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Happy Coding</h1>
		<p>Hello world!</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

Your directory structure should look like this:

- `apache-tomcat-x.y.z/`
  - `bin/`
    - `startup.bat`
    - `(files you don't care about)`
  - `(more files you don't care about)`
  - `webapps/`
    - `(some example web apps)`
    - `HelloWorld/`
      - `index.html`

Now open your web browser to [http://localhost:8080/HelloWorld/index.html](http://localhost:8080/HelloWorld/index.html), and you should see this:

![Tomcat hello world](/tutorials/java-server/images/tomcat-3.png)

Notice that you didn't have to restart the Tomcat server. It should automatically detect changes to the `webapps` folder.

Congratulations, you just wrote your first web app! :tada:

## Example Project

So far, the whole web app is a single HTML file, but if it helps, you can view and download this project here:

{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/examples/java-server/hello-world-static-website" %}

# Root Web App

Notice that the URL for your web app contains the `HelloWorld` directory. This is useful if you have multiple web apps running on the same server, but you also might want to create a "top level" web app that doesn't include its name in its URL. To do that, create a web app named `root`.

Tomcat comes with a default `root` webapp, which contains links to documentation. You can delete that and replace it with your own `root` directory.

In that `root` folder, save this HTML to another file named `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Root Web App</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Root Web App</h1>
		<p><a href="http://localhost:8080/HelloWorld/index.html">Here</a> is a link to the Hello World app.</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

Now open up your web browser to [http://localhost:8080/index.html](http://localhost:8080/index.html), and you should see this:

![Tomcat root web app](/tutorials/java-server/images/jetty-setup-3.png)

Note that this URL does not contain the `root` directory.

Also note that you can link between web apps, just like you can link between web pages- because that's what these are!

# Examples

{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/examples/java-server/hello-world-static-website" %}
