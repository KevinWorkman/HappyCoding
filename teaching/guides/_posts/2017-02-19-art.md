People who have no experience with code tend to think of it as being all ones and zeroes, or a bunch of complicated math. It's not! Code can be used to create art, interactive visualizations, and all sorts of beautiful things. [Creative coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_coding) is a just the tip of the iceburg.

The tutorials on this site are designed specifically with creative coding in mind. (If you can think of any ways for me to improve this, please [let me know](/about/contact)!) So if you're teaching students who are interested in art, you're in the right place!

One thing I'd recommend is trying to find projects ([here are a few](/gallery/links)) that speak to the interests of your students.

Fun fact: Processing was created by an artist and a data visualization scientist!
