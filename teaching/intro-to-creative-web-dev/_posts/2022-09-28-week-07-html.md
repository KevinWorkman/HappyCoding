# HTML - Week 07

{% include toc.md %}

Welcome to week 7 of Intro to Creative Web Dev!

Now you've seen the fundamentals of coding in p5.js. This week you'll be learning a new language called HTML, and using that to build a webpage!

Work through the activities in this page to complete the week.

# From p5.js to HTML

To help you transition from p5.js to HTML, first read through this tutorial:

{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/html/from-p5js-to-html" %}

---

# HTML

After you have your Replit editor set up with a new HTML project, read through this tutorial:

{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/html/html" %}

# Project

Now you know how to make a webpage by writing HTML in the Replit editor.

To practice that, create a webpage using at least **ten** HTML tags.

Use resources like [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/) to learn about HTML tags. And don't be afraid to search for new tags!

For example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>My First Webpage</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Hello world!</h1>
		<p>Here are my favorite animals:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lions</li>
      <li>Tigers</li>
      <li>Bears</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="https://happycoding.io/images/stanley-1.jpg" />
    <p>Learn more at <a href="https://happycoding.io">Happy Coding</a>!</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

This code contains 11 HTML tags: `DOCTYPE` (technically this isn't an HTML tag but I'm counting it anyway), `html`, `head`, `title`, `body`, `h1`, `p`, `ul`, `li`, `img`, and `a`

Try creating a webpage that introduces yourself. What are your hobbies, favorite movies or songs, or favorite places to eat?

# Styling Content

This week is all about setting up your environment and learning HTML, which tells your browser what types of content to display. Your browser has some default rules about how to style different types of content. For example, headings are large and bold, and links are blue and underlined.

If you want to customize the styles of your content, like changing colors or layout, you’ll need to go beyond HTML and use CSS.

For now, focus on HTML without worrying too much about styling. You’ll learn about CSS next week!
