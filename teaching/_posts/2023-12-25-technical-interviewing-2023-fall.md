# Technical Interviewing

I taught this class in fall 2023. It was loosely inspired by [Stanford CS 9](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs9/).

During this class, students learned about various data structures and algorithms, and practiced using them in technical interviewing questions.

Each week, the class focused on a different concept. The class met Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, where Mondays and Wednesdays were lectures, and Fridays were generally group discussions or activities. Weekly assignments included Leetcode problems and peer interviews.

Instead of a final exam, I met with every student individually for a mock interview, which I graded based on a rubric that I shared ahead of time.
