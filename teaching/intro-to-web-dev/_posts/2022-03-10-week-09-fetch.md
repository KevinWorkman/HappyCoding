# Fetch - Week 09

{% include toc.md %}

Welcome to week 9 of Intro to Web Dev!

   - Callback functions
   - Anonymous functions
   - Arrow functions
   - Async and await

   *Note: There isn't really a wrong answer to this question, I just want you to think about the pros and cons and your own personal coding preferences.*
