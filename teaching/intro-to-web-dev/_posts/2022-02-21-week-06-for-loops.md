# For Loops and Arrays - Week 06

{% include toc.md %}

Welcome to week 6 of Intro to Web Dev!

Now you know how to use JavaScript, and you know how yo use `if` statements, which let you make decisions in your code. This week you'll learn about `for` loops, which let you repeat code multiple times, and arrays, which let you store multiple values in a single variable.

Work through the activities in this page to complete the week!
