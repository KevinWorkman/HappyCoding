# JavaScript Libraries - Week 07

{% include toc.md %}

Welcome to week 7 of Intro to Web Dev!

Now you know how to write your own JavaScript code. This week you'll learn about JavaScript libraries, which let you use code written by other people!

Work through the activities in this page to complete the week!

# p5.js

Now that you've learned about JavaScript libraries, I want to introduce you to my favorite library: [p5.js](/tutorials/p5js)!

One thing I love about p5.js is that it's a great way to practice the fundamentals of JavaScript in a fun environment. So if you've been struggling with JavaScript, please use this week as a chance to revisit the concepts in p5.js!

# Project

Now you've seen the fundamentals of JavaScript libraries and p5.js.

To practice these concepts, modify the files in the `week-07-p5js` directory of your project repo.

If you want some inspiration, check out these p5.js examples:
