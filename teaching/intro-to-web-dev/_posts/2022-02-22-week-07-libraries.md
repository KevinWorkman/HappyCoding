# p5.js

Now that you've learned about JavaScript libraries, I want to introduce you to my favorite library: [p5.js](/tutorials/p5js)!

One thing I love about p5.js is that it's a great way to practice the fundamentals of JavaScript in a fun environment. So if you've been struggling with JavaScript, please use this week as a chance to revisit the concepts in p5.js!

Now you've seen the fundamentals of JavaScript libraries and p5.js.

To practice these concepts, modify the files in the `week-07-p5js` directory of your project repo.

If you want some inspiration, check out these p5.js examples:
