# Layout - Week 03

{% include toc.md %}

Welcome to week 3 of Intro to Web Dev!

{% include youtube-embed.html slug="nxB2lfbJ7eg" %}

Last week, you used CSS to style your HTML by setting things like font colors. CSS can also be used for positioning elements and laying out your page. There are a lot of different ways to do that, so I wanted to spend this week on just this aspect of CSS.

Work through the activities in this page to complete the week!

# Layout

*Estimated time: 90 minutes*

First, read through the tutorial and watch the video:

{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/html/layout" %}

{% include youtube-embed.html slug="KpGeXg84Zh4" %}

# Project

*Estimated time: 1 hour*

Now you've seen the fundamentals of layout in CSS, including flexbox and grid.

To practice that, modify the files in the `week-03-layout` directory of your project repo.

{% include youtube-embed.html slug="lebupYDBnJg" %}
