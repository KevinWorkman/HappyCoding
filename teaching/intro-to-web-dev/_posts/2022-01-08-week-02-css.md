# CSS - Week 02

{% include toc.md %}

{% include youtube-embed.html slug="3OYpn0SZfdE" %}

Welcome to week 2 of Intro to Web Dev!

Last week, you set up your GitHub repo and your coding environment. You learned about HTML, and you used HTML tags to build a webpage.

HTML tells the browser what kind of content to display. Browsers have a few default styles, for example headings are big and bold, and links are blue and underlined. If you want to add your own styling, like different fonts, colors, and effects, then you need to go beyond HTML and use CSS.

Work through the activities in this page to complete the week!

Now you've seen the fundamentals of CSS and styling content.

To practice that, modify the files in the `week-02-css` directory of your project repo.
