# JavaScript Objects - Week 08

{% include toc.md %}

Welcome to week 8 of Intro to Web Dev!

Now you know how to write your own JavaScript code, and how to store multiple values using arrays. This week you'll learn about JavaScript objects, which let you store related values together!

Work through the activities in this page to complete the week!

# JavaScript Objects

First, watch this video and read through the tutorial to learn about JavaScript objects:

{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/javascript/objects" %}

# Project

Now you've seen the fundamentals of JavaScript objects.

To practice these concepts, modify the files in the `week-08-objects` directory of your project repo.

**Note:** I'm only going to grade the first **two** requirements in the repo's `README.md` file. So when you finish the project, you code should contain:

- An array with 10 objects, with at least 3 fields in each object
- A for loop that builds the page HTML based on the values in the array

# Checklist

1. Learn about objects
2. Follow the directions in the `week-08-objects` directory of your project repo (keep in mind the above note)
3. Push those changes to GitHub and confirm you can see them in your GitHub Pages site
4. Get ready to present your work. Make sure your camera and microphone work!
