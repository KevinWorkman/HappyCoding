# Extra Topics - Week 14

{% include toc.md %}

Welcome to week 14 of Intro to Web Dev!

At this point, you should be working on your final project. While you do that, this week will cover a few extra topics that we didn't get to in previous weeks.

My goal with these topics is to provide a high-level introduction so you can learn more if you choose to. I'm not expecting you to memorize anything or incorporate any of these topics into your final project.

# Coding

These topics build on your coding experience to introduce other coding structures:

{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/javascript/objects" %}

# Fetch

This topic introduces an approach for getting data from other websites and servers:

{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/javascript/fetch" %}

If we have time I'll also talk about creating your own server!

# Accessibility

This topic introduces techniques you can use to make sure your webpages work for people with accessibility issues:
