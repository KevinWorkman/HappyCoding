# Bootstrap - Week 12

{% include toc.md %}

Welcome to week 12 of Intro to Web Dev!

Now you know how to write your own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to build and design a webpage. This week you'll learn about Bootstrap, which handles a lot of that for you!

Work through the activities in this page to complete the week!

# Bootstrap

First, learn about Bootstrap:

{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/javascript/bootstrap" %}

# Project - Bootstrapify a Business Webpage

Now you know how to use libraries in your code, including Bootstrap. To practice that, you're going to use Bootstrap to create a webpage for a fake business.

{% include youtube-embed.html slug="bHabiG3_TQk" %}

The business can be real, imaginary, or aspirational. You can reuse your business from week 4, or you can use a different one.

Your code should contain the following:

- Loading the Bootstrap JavaScript library
- Loading the Bootstrap CSS library
- At least 3 Bootstrap components

Alternatively, each of the following will also count as a single Bootstrap component:

- Bootstrap grid
- Loading a Bootstrap theme instead of the default CSS library
- Overriding a Bootstrap style with your own CSS

Don't limit yourself to a single HTML file. Feel free to include multiple files that link to each other. For example you might have an `index.html` homepage, an `about.html` page that contains a description of your page, and a `photos.html` page that contains images. Each of these might use a different Bootstrap component.
