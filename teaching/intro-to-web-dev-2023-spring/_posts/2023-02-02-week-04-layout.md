# Layout - Week 04

{% include toc.md %}

Welcome to week 04 of Intro to Web Dev!

Last week, you used CSS to style your HTML by setting style properties like fonts and colors. CSS can also be used for positioning elements and laying out your page.

Work through the activities in this page to complete the week!

# Layout

First, read through this tutorial:

{% include url-thumbnail.html url="/tutorials/html/layout" %}

**Note:** This tutorial contains a few ways to approach layout in CSS, but feel free to focus on the **flexbox** section since that's what we'll be using in class.

# Project - Fake Business Site

Now you know how to style your webpage using CSS. To practice that, this week you're going to create a webpage for a business.

{% include youtube-embed.html slug="-QpcHCIJWLQ" %}

The business can be real, imaginary, or aspirational. Get creative! Here are some ideas:

- Your favorite local business
- A bookstore that only sells your favorite books
- A photography studio that specializes in pictures of your pet

Your website should contain at least **ten** flexbox properties. The properties can be on parent or child elements- likely a combination of both. The properties don't have to be unique; for example two divs with `display: flex` will count as two flex properties.

Don't limit yourself to a single HTML file. Feel free to include multiple files that link to each other. For example you might have an `index.html` homepage, an `about.html` page that contains a description of your page, and a `photos.html` page that contains images. Each of these might use different flexbox properties to create different layouts.

Use resources like [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/), [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), and [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/) to learn about CSS style rules. And don't be afraid to search for new CSS properties and HTML tags!

For example:

**index.html**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Styled Text</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="header">My Fake Business</div>

      <div class="main">
        <div class="left">
          <ul>
            <li>Home</li>
            <li>About</li>
            <li>Images</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
          <p>Welcome to my fake business!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="right">
          <ul>
            <li>Things</li>
            <li>Stuff</li>
            <li>Other Things</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div>Thanks for visiting my fake business!</div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

**style.css**

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.container div {
  border: thin solid black;
  margin: 5px;
  padding: 5px;
}

.main {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.content {
  flex-grow: 1;
}
```

![fake business page](/teaching/intro-to-web-dev-2022-fall/images/layout-1.png)

This code contains five flex properties: `display: flex` (twice), `flex-direction: column`, `justify-content: space-between`, and `flex-grow: 1`. For full credit, you'd need to add five properties!
