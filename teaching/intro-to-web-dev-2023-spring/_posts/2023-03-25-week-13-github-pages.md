# GitHub Pages - Week 13

{% include toc.md %}

Welcome to week 13 of Intro to Web Dev!

**Note:** This week's project is extra credit. I encourage you to complete it so you can have a professional portfolio for your resume, so it's worth 10 bonus points. But if you choose to skip it, it won't count against you.

Now you know how to write your own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to build and design a webpage. You also know how to use JavaScript libraries like p5.js and Bootstrap.

You've been using Replit and the p5.js editor to create your project. These are great tools for smaller projects and prototypes, because they let you quickly edit your code and immediately see the result.

But as you build more complicated webpages, you'll generally use a separate host for your files. This week you'll learn about a host called GitHub Pages.

Work through the activities in this page to complete the week!

# GitHub Pages

First, learn about GitHub Pages:

# Project - Portfolio Page

Now you know how to use GitHub Pages to host a webpage. For this week's project, you'll use GitHub Pages to create your own personal portfolio page.

Personal portfolio pages are a great way to improve your resume. You can't fit everything you've ever done on a resume, but you can link to your portfolio page!

What you include in your portfolio page is totally up to you. You might include links to your previous projects from this class, or you might include images of projects you've worked on for other classes, or anything else really. You might use Bootstrap to design your page, or you might create your own CSS from scratch. You might also use p5.js or another JavaScript library to make your page stand out.

Because your portfolio page is so unique to you, I'm not giving you any strict requirements. As long as you have a page you can link to, you'll get the 10 bonus points. I encourage you to make it your own!
