# Teaching

I'm a firm believer in the idea of *"low floors, high ceilings, and wide walls"* in education. Happy Coding starts with the fundamentals of coding, with tutorials and guides designed for folks who have never seen code before. These lead to advanced topics like server-side coding, Android development, and even interviewing for a job. So no matter what you're teaching, I hope there's something here you can use.

Happy Coding has been used as the source material for several classes, taught by myself and other folks. This page collects the classes that I know about.
