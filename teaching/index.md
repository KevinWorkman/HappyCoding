# Teaching

I absolutely LOVE hearing from teachers using Happy Coding's content in their classrooms. I originally wrote the tutorials with self-learners in mind, but I think they're pretty adaptable to a classroom environment as well.

Specifically, I'd recommend using [the tutorials](/tutorials) as lecture material, then using [the examples](/examples) as lab and homework assignments.

Happy Coding goes from the fundamentals of coding designed for folks who have never seen code before, all the way to advanced topics like server-side coding and Android development. So no matter what you're teaching, I hope there's something here you can use.

I'm not a teacher myself, but I have some experience with online mentorship, writing a curriculum, and presenting workshops through things like Google's [Software Product Sprint](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/softwareproductsprint/) and [STEP internship](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/step/), as well as [CC Fest](http://ccfest.rocks/).

With all of that said, the articles below break down the different ways you might use Happy Coding in different kinds of classrooms and contexts.
