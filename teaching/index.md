# Teaching

Happy Coding starts with the fundamentals of coding designed for folks who have never seen code before, and leads to advanced topics like server-side coding and Android development. So no matter what you're teaching, I hope there's something here you can use.

# Intro to Web Dev

# Contact Me!

I absolutely love *love* **LOVE** hearing from teachers using Happy Coding's content in their classrooms. I do all of this for fun, for free, in my spare time, and the only way I know it's useful is if you tell me.

So **please** [contact me](/about#contact) and let me know if you're using Happy Coding in your classroom. You'll make my day.

I'm also very interested in collaborating and making Happy Coding more useful for teachers. So if you're a teacher and you have ideas about what would make this easier for you to use, please reach out!
