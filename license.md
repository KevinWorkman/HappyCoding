## What does this mean?

It means you're free to use anything you find on the site for whatever you want, as long as you give credit back to [HappyCoding.io](http://HappyCoding.io).

I'd also love to hear from you if you found something useful on the site! I maintain this site in my spare time, and the thing that makes it all worthwhile is hearing from self-learners, teachers, and students who found it useful.

## What do you mean by giving credit?

Think about it this way: if somebody views your work and wants to learn more about programming, then you should let them know about [HappyCoding.io](http://HappyCoding.io). How you do that depends on the type of work you're doing: if you're creating an app, then a link in the *about* section would be fine. If you're creating digital art that will be shown in a gallery, then a link in the description would be fine.

## Can I use the tutorials if I'm a teacher or student?

Absolutely. That's one of the main reasons I started the site. I'd love to hear how you're using the site in your class or curriculum.

If you're a teacher, you might also consider uploading any slides or assignments you come up with. You're under no obligation to do this, but the spirit of open source is all about sharing your work with others, so definitely think about it!

## Can I use code I find on Happy Coding in a paid application or exhibit?

Sure, as long as you still provide a link to [HappyCoding.io](http://HappyCoding.io) letting people know where to find more info about learning how to program.

## Does my code also have to be open-source if I base it off something I saw on Happy Coding?

Nope! You are welcome to use the code however you want, including in a closed-source application. I'd encourage you to consider open-source, but in the end it's up to you. The only thing you must do is provide a link to [HappyCoding.io](http://HappyCoding.io) letting people know where to find more info about learning how to program.

## Can I use the non-code content of the site?

Yep, everything is released under the [Creative Commons Attribution License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), including non-code content such as the text of the tutorials. If you're a teacher or student, feel free to use this stuff however you want! Just provide the link back to [HappyCoding.io](http://HappyCoding.io) and optionally, please let me know if you found it useful!

## Can I submit changes to the content?

Absolutely! Happy Coding is a [GitHub project](https://github.com/KevinWorkman/HappyCoding), so submitting a change is as simple as submitting a pull request. Go to [ our GitHub repository](https://github.com/KevinWorkman/HappyCoding/wiki/Contributing) for more info on how you can contribute.

## I still have a question!

Please [contact me](http://HappyCoding.io/about/contact.html) if you have any other questions, or if you just want to chat about anything on the site.
