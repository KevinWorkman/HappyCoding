**What is Happy Coding?**

Many people have asked me how to learn how to program, or how to build an app, or make a website, or create digital art, or visualize data. This website is my answer to all of those questions.

I'm going to fill this website with tutorials, example code, and ideas to get you started learning how to program. If you already know how to program, then hopefully this site is a useful reference.

I'm also hoping to build a community of people who want to talk about learning how to code or programming in general at [forum.HappyCoding.io](http://forum.happycoding.io)

**I have a question or a request!**

The best thing to do is post something on [the forum](http://forum.happycoding.io/).

You can also find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/StaticVoidGames) and [facebook](http://www.facebook.com/StaticVoidGames).

This entire site is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/KevinWorkman/HappyCoding), so you can also submit issues there.

If all else fails, feel free to email me at kevin@HappyCoding.io.

**Who are you?**

My name is Kevin Workman. I :heart: coding. I've been programming since high school (so, uh, over ten years now). By day I do [prototype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype) development, but I've always been more interested in [creative coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_coding) and the education side of things. Coding opens up new worlds of creativity, and I'd love to share that with more people.

**What makes Happy Coding different than other tutorial sites?**

People learn in different ways, and I don't think education is a zero-sum game. Learning isn't an either/or type of thing. So I don't think this site is an *alternative* to other tutorial sites. I think you should take bits and pieces from all over the place and see what you like best.

I love what people like [Daniel Shiffman](http://shiffman.net/) and sites like [Fun Programming](http://funprogramming.org/), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming), and [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/) are doing. I'm a big fan of all of the above.

But I'm designing this site for people who learn like I learn. I'm building the type of site that I wish existed when I was learning programming.

**Where did you get the background images?**

They all come from [Subtle Patterns](http://subtlepatterns.com/)!
