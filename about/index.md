# About Happy coding

## What is Happy Coding?

Happy Coding is not a company. I'm just one guy doing this for fun in my free time.

Happy Coding evolved from [various coding projects](/blog/ten-years) and has grown into a collection of tutorials, examples, and blog posts that I've been writing since 2016.

But more than that, I'm hoping to build a community of people who want to talk about code, learning, equity, and creativity. If that sounds like you, come say hello world on the [Happy Coding Forum](https://forum.happycoding.io)!

## Who are you?

Hi! My name is Kevin Workman. By day I work at Google. I started in Google Maps, helped run [Software Product Sprint](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/softwareproductsprint) in my "20%" time, and currently work as the Curriculum Lead of an internal training program called Google Developer Academy. In my "spare time" I also teach as an adjunct professor at [Millersville University](https://millersville.edu).

## Contact

If you have a question, or if you just want to chat, please don't hesitate to reach out!

The best way to reach me is by posting on [forum.HappyCoding.io](https://forum.HappyCoding.io).

Joining the forum is also the best way to stay up to date on Happy Coding, since the forum sends digest emails when I post new tutorials, examples, and blog entries.

This entire site is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/KevinWorkman/HappyCoding), so you can also submit issues there.

## What makes Happy Coding different than other tutorial sites?

People learn in different ways, and I don't think education is a zero-sum game. Learning isn't an either/or type of thing. So I don't think this site is an *alternative* to other tutorial sites. I think you should take bits and pieces from all over the place and see what you like best.

I love what people like [Daniel Shiffman](http://shiffman.net/) and sites like [OpenProcessing](https://openprocessing.org/), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming), and [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) are doing. I'm a big fan of all of the above.

But I'm designing this site for people who learn like I learn. I'm building the type of site that I wish existed when I was learning how to code. Hopefully you also find it interesting.
